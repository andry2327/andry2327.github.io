 and technology but first of all as usual we have any question about the first part something that is not clear something that you want to ask or was everything okay no question so if there are no other questions we can continue just briefly recap what we have said we say that there is an interplay between law and technology and the relationship between law and technology is that the law can be used in order to shape technology but we can also use technology in order to implement some law provisions some required behavior that through the technology can be more can be stronger in terms of constraint in terms of the push to be in line with what is required by the law this was the by design approach the idea so to create a design system that intrinsically limit some possibility as regards of the use of the device that is not aligned with the legal requirement and this is the so-called by design approach that is used and we have discussed about the opportunities and the limitations of this kind of application other we M yeah system and yeah art just the arrived his alter tunnel and was discuss as one of the key elements that the technology question because new technology increase the number of creating society faces to many instruments that are mitigation measure who is and in the case in which the risk not possible to measure and properly assessונon pro ogni usses his up yeah him emoji i'm varmata does is just to work out last grace no will cast about that regulation with his cast on you level you perspective there is not only also during the discussion we see that there is a lot of interplay between you context we can say and other area mainly the u.s. because there is a we do but also other the reason week for the use of data sometimes that's remain snack rash in China they want did initial ralwe the mindset god yeah road while i steam world all included is not nons gardens so is overlapping in this regard should be considered national second one aspect of this relationship is there so if you look at it national dimension the relationship we can see that for instance if you look at that products convert to many other products are easy to be share and distributed all over the world and of course the distribution of products all over the world means that this rise problem of conformity with the national regulation as we say that national regulation are terribly based so it means that in some countries some products could be commercialized only under certain specific requirements so this transnational dimension is something that we have to take into account when we talk about the product when we talk about also protective products such as copyrighted materials etc. because of course there is a problem concerning on one hand the conformity to the local standard and on the other hand the increasing risk that in other countries some provisions that regulate and protect the materials, the products that you realize can be infringed and this is the case in instance of the copyright has been for a long time the case of the copyright so what it means, it means that the first issue related to the fact that when you want to put on the market in another country some product you should take into account some restrictions that might exist for instance there was an important case years ago that was the eBay case in which through eBay was made available some materials about the Nazi and fascist period and these materials were made available in France and in France there is a criminal law that forbids any kind of commercialization of Nazi and fascist materials unfortunately we have not the same in it but in France exists and so there was the problem that these materials made available online through eBay were of course available also in the France territory and this is what we said last time the difficulties in combining a global network like internet and the traditional territory based approach of the state regulation so before internet was not an issue because if we have a shop and you put in the shop some Nazi symbols or materials of course the police can check and remove them and give you a sanction but online is much more difficult because if you put something on eBay this is available in France, in Germany, whatever you want including countries in which this is illegal so this raised the problem of the transnational dimension of the internet now consider the limitation of this course we cannot dig in all the issues and the way in which we can solve or address this kind of problem but just to point out that when you make something and made it available online you have to consider that it is available in different jurisdictions and in some jurisdictions that activity or that product can be not allowed by the law and this can entail problems for your business or for the selling of your product or for the selling of your product on the positive side copyright infringement case is interesting because here we have a situation in which we have almost a general protection because with regard to copyright I have the right international agreement at a very high level almost all the jurisdictions recognize copyright and there is a sort of international harmonization about the copyright regulation so here we have not a problem of a lot of differences among countries but yes we have a problem of the enforcement of this provision what it means is that if you have a copyright product that is made available for instance on your website or whatever you want the same product can be downloaded in the case of scientific paper for instance can be legitimately downloaded by a user in your country but then reused in another platform, legal platform make it available for free in other countries for instance I remember years ago I was invited to China by a Chinese university and we had a nice interesting meeting with a Chinese businessman and this brilliant idea to grab and download all the scientific paper and make them available in its own platform in China for the Chinese audience we can say and he didn't realize that it was not possible he said why not? I downloaded and made it available okay but there is a copyright protection you know we have to ask for and make an agreement just to point out that is not so generally accepted this idea that exists protected materials so it might be the case and it is the case that there are platforms that are website that redistribute protected materials without any authorization without any license so of course in this case there is a problem of infringement there is a clear infringement of the copyrighted loan but what is the problem here related to the transnational dimension? the problem here is the enforcement because of course there is a problem that it's clear that there is infringement but how to enforce in a country that is far from your country you have to make a legal action in that country so it's expensive in terms of cost you have to fight in that country that can be known so strong in terms of attention and focus on these kind of issues and at the end of the day you have to find a company or a natural person that is able to pay for the damage that they create and sometimes you find a very small company that have no money of course you can stop the illicit behavior that is fine but you cannot have a compensation for the damages of course there are strong systems for criminal infringement for instance for child abuse or child pornography etc it's possible through the legal provision according to Italy but also in other countries criminal provision you can stop at a high level national system of DSM you cannot have access to the WLP that are selected because they distribute child pornography or other illicit content this is a strong instrument because it blocks at a level of network so you cannot have access but of course if it's good in terms of reducing the distribution of the material also in this case we have the problem of the legal enforcement so if you want to punish these people if you want to reach them and put them in jail of course again we have a problem of the transnational dimension so you need a legal order that should be enforced in that country and you have to arrest them make a trial in that country or ask for a trial in your country for international cooperation on the judiciary sector so again it's quite difficult and this is a continuous struggle that is related to the fact that we have two dimensions the national dimension and the international dimension of the network and unfortunately the online networks are more pervasive and more immaterial we can say than other networks because we have also for instance global network for flights or for goods or for supply chain but they are much more concrete we can say and it's easier to stop to some extent the flow so to regulate the flow in internet this is much more difficult there are many solutions that permit to circumvent the gate if you want to stop some flights you can't stop some flights coming from some country because you act on the airport they cannot land in the airport but in internet you cannot stop landing content in your country it's much more difficult so this is the first aspect that we always have to take into account when we discuss about privacy about digital content etc that we could have the best law in our country or in Europe but then there is the problem of what happens outside how we can protect outside for this reason in the GDPR, in the proposal of AI Act in the digital service act, in many recent provisions of the European Union there is a focus on this extra territorial effect we can say and it's more and more required by the EU to have the power to extend the application of the law also outside the European Union border when there is an activity that might affect the citizens or the people that live in Europe it's something that we will see when we discuss about the scope of the GDPR the GDPR is applicable not only to the company or to the person that are based in Europe but also when foreign companies based in another country process personal data affecting people that are in Europe and this of course is an extra territorial application of an EU law this kind of extra territorial application again represents a derogation to the territory based approach of the state law and of course create at international level some reaction or conflicts with other countries because it means that you entitle your entity, in this case the European Union to extend its power to something that is done in another country due to the fact that that activity may affect your citizens or the people living in Europe of course this extension of power that is done in another country in which for instance these activities are omitted or not regulated and creates a certain clash between the traditional idea of state territory competence is accepted in some countries, accepted with regard for data protection for instance because of course then there are geopolitical reasons the strength of the European Union market and the fact that it was also sort of we can say a sort of persistent approach the EU was able to convince many countries to adopt similar rules as regard to data protection the so called Brussels effect that maybe we mention in the next classes so for a series of reasons for the moment in the field of data protection this extra territorial approach of the European Union does not create a lot of reaction only in few countries but of course you cannot imagine that we can always have this approach and on the other hand there are also other countries that say oh but we can do the same and we can ask the European provider to be compliant to the law in our countries although they are based in Europe and of course when this is required by countries that are not so democratically oriented there is a lot of problem and concern so this is a topic that I want to just outline because we are not tired to dig too much on that but is behind the entire discussion on the background we have this big problem of transnational dimension another big problem that we have not necessarily in data protection but for instance in content moderation or in the discussion about ethics is the transcultural dimension transcultural dimension means that there are not only different territories in terms of regulation but there are also different cultures and the cultural dimension is more and more relevant when we imagine to create our own life using the suggestion by a famous philosopher our life means mixing the online and the offline life in this experience that connects these two dimensions of course your activity transposing in the online environment can this activity represent your culture and your view or your attitude with regard to society and the world but what is the problem? the problem is that in different cultures the same behaviour can be classified in different ways if you go to asia for instance in some country in the travel guide there is a specific note for Europeans that say that some behaviour in Europe are considered as common in that country are considered as offensive or not accepted and is the same if you read the guidelines for the people coming to Europe so there are differences in cultures so imagine to transpose the difference in content moderation when you have to decide to take down a video for instance in a platform like YouTube of course what is the difference between joking or being defamatory something that in Italy can be considered as joking in another country can be considered very offensive according to the specific culture of that area so you can imagine how much is difficult for a platform to manage these kind of issues because there are several options the first option is to transpose in the global platform the mindset of the platform owners and it's something that we have seen with Facebook you remember that Facebook decided to take down some paintings or some photos of women breast because it was considered as a game day, time and condition how we can classify this attitude is a very conservative US approach about sex in which they are concerned by the way, US society is not so concerned they are concerned about the fact that showing the breast of a woman is considered as a problem why if you look to all the ancient Greek or Roman statues and arts and also post-fact in the following centuries there are a lot of nudity and nobody is concerned and for the reason they also take down some paintings without any discrimination because the AI is not able to discriminate between photos and paintings at that time the problem is that this reflects an approach that is the approach of the platform owner that through time and condition for this reason we mentioned the relevance of the contract in shaping the sphere through time and condition decide what is the sector worth not but according to its own country if you come from Italy you can be considered funding some provisions and limitations or if you come from another country you can consider too low we can say the level of prohibition because another country is not only a problem of breast but also other parts of the body should not be publicly shown so this problem of trans-cultural dimension that can be addressed through a top-down regulation created these kind of issues or can be addressed in a more difficult way through a contestual based approach and what is now is doing by some of the big platforms so created things with local expertise with a variety in terms of culture that can say oh this is Italian joking but in India this is not joking and this is the same situation classified different based on the expertise of local experts that are able to provide the correct contestualization we can say of the message with regard to the content that they see and this is just mentioned but as you are computer scientist this also shows another hidden part that I know if you discuss in other courses but it is also related to the topic of data editor which we do not need to mention the other issue is about the development of AI that AI is not only through algorithms but also through computer scientists as you know but there are a lot of people thousands of people that work behind the scenes supporting this smart AI due to the fact that it is not so smart so labelling tests, labelling images removing content etc so large part of the AI performance is not based necessarily on the quality algorithm but based on thousands of people that make this sort of debugging activity many of them labelled images many of them take down context all this activity that is generally called mechanical tour activities is something that we don't know but it raises a lot of concern also in terms of ethical approach because we talk about people in some low income country who are asked to stay 8 hours in front of shocking images about child pornography, violence or other kinds of content in order to support content removal in order to train all the AI to make possible a better automatisation of content removal so this part of the human side of the artificial intelligence and science is missing in the debate but it is a relevant part and is being investigated by researchers at the global level so this is about the trans-cultural dimension that we have to consider when we discuss and address the issues related to digital technologies and the last point is about the regular competition that is related to the previous two points so if there are differences if we have seen that there are global problems and different territory and regulatory approach of course what it means it means that this creates a sort of competition in regulating the global sphere of digital life because if different countries have different approaches in regulating at local level in their territory there is no problem but who will regulate at global level what will be the standard at the global level as all the process there is a trend in favour of a sort of uniformity a sort of harmonisation we cannot leave having dozens of different regulations we have to more or less converge towards a sort of general approach this process of harmonisation is common in many many sectors and is common also in the field of law but if the certain points are different systems different rules this means that this variety creates a regulatory competition what it means regulatory competition it means that each geographical area each state or aggregation of state we try to put the flag and say oh we regulate internet, we regulate data we regulate content moderation in this way that is my way this creates a problem of regulatory competition at international level in the international bodies or also in the bilateral interaction for instance between EU and US there is a clear struggle in order to decide who is the rule maker who is able to set the rules in a sphere that is bigger than its own original territory area and we have seen that in data for instance the fact that the data protection approach in Europe is expanding around the world of course is very positive and make the EU give the EU a leadership in terms of data protection regulation but for instance in US we are not so happy about that and now they try to realign their position with new specific regulation and based on the experience are much more reactive with AI regulation in the AI regulation for instance Europe started to regulate to discuss about the regulation of AI and the AI was sort of was the actor that made the first step in this direction but immediately there was the reaction from the US that decided not to lose this spotlight happened with the data and they present some counter proposals some different kind of opinion and now there is a lot of interaction between the US bodies mainly the NIST that is the National Institution of Standards and the Feeds of Technologies and the EU body in order to agree on some common points of course this is a limitation to the potential potential expansive EU approach and there is a sort of gentleman agreement between the big player in order to find a more compatible solution in terms of AI regulation so this regulation competition is very strong and is very relevant of course not only in the digital sphere environment, antitrust, there are many other fields in which the leadership of one country in terms of regulation was extended to other countries that adopt similar standards just to give you an example now the large majority of the countries around the world that adopt a data protection law, adopt a data protection law that is based on the European standard so this is a field in which the EU framework had an impact at global level of course as I mentioned it's one of the few, many other like antitrust, environment etc. and the US model is stronger than the European one ok so after this introduction about the law and technology in general and the relationship between law and technology a few words about other key concepts that you have to know of course I'm aware that it's not easy to follow all these different blocks but like all the introduction to our new subject, the fact that we have no experience in the field of law it is necessary to set some key notion I have to put the light on some aspect concerning technology the role of law the interaction between both and some key idea the territory regulation and the global regulation and in this case liability because in the course during the course we will discuss about law and legal requirement as we said the peculiarity of a legal requirement or legal provision is that can be enforced that you have to respect the law and if you don't there is a sanction or there is a kind of liability so we have to spend a few words about the liability of course there is a type of liability that is the criminal or administrative liability and this is not discussed in this slide but it is also easy to understand a criminal liability is mainly personal liability usually it is not the company that is criminal liable there are only a few sections in corporate liability but it is the individual person that is liable so if there is a copyright infringement for instance and this is a violation of the criminal law you are considered liable and the criminal liability is mainly in one sense according to the gravity of the action and there are different kinds of punishments we can say but all are based on the fact that there is a limitation of your rights so the punishment can be paying money, limitation of your right to property or putting someone in jail limitation to your freedom so the final end in the criminal process is only a limitation of individual rights the important point that you have to keep in mind is that the criminal liability such as the administrative liability this is only a softer form of sanctioning not based on putting the people in jail but asking to pay money basically and extending this obligation to pay money not only to natural person but also to company but this two forms the criminal and administrative liability are basically focused on the idea that they act in the public interest they are part of public law in this regard so what I want to say I want to say that when someone is put in jail or asked to pay money this do not solve the problem of the damage that is our activity created it is only the sanction that the state provide to this person or entity in order first to punish the person, second to limit the propensity or the tendency of other people to replicate the same bad behavior so the focus is the social interest not to have some kind of behavior put in jail that committed this infringement and give also in this way an example to the other not to follow the bad path we can say but this do not solve the problem of the damage they created to give a very concrete example if there is a data breach and they take a lot of information from your server and make a lot of money having access to bank account of course they can be put in jail but this do not solve the problem that you have to have a lot of damage in terms of cost that you have to cover and the people suffer damage in terms of money that they have lost and to recover this kind of cost you have to act through the legal action but in the civil law in the civil arena and this is the liability the civil law liability it means asking some form of a redress some forms of protection for the interest that were infringed by some behavior usually asking for money if you have a damage or restoring the previous situation as far as possible so it is important to not to mix the two elements the criminal sanction although in terms of money is only for the state the money goes to the state and the money or other sanction are just to punish the person and to give a message to the rest of the people but this does not solve the problem of the damage suffered by the people that are the victims and the victims if they weren't any kind any form of restoring of this damage that they have suffered they have to make a legal action then of course the legal action can be is a civil law action or you can say a tort action in the common law system but an action based not on criminal law but based on private law we can say so it is a private law action in some system like in Italy this action can be also presented in front of the criminal court but remains a private law action because the goal is to have the payment of the damage the restoration of the damage that they have suffered and in this regard with regard to liability of course in terms of regulation of technology there is an issue to define how we set this liability who is liable how far they are liable because there are two extreme positions if you want on one hand you can say every time that there is a damage the entity that created that damage is liable of course if you adopt this approach is very good for the victims because there is always someone that pay but it is a huge burden that you put on the shoulder of those that create the damage on the other hand there is the old traditional approach based on food that also from ethics and from religion is the ethical mindset you are liable because you have done something bad and you were aware that you have done something bad because there was intention to make something then or there was an agitance so therefore it is based on system what is the problem the problem is that the traditional approach that is based on food does not work well in the technology context because when you have a product that is relied by a machine for instance some problem in the function of the machine create a product with some specific weakness that put in a car can create an accident who is liable there is no one that has a fault in that case because it was the machine or there are case in which there is a human fault for instance you make a mistake in coding some part of a program this creates some bugs etc so we have the people the person that is liable that is who code that part and we know who code that part but if the damage created because the software was used by bank etc is of thousands or millions of euro the single person that code that plan is not able to pay so it is true that the fault system has able to identify an actor that is liable but that actor is not able to pay so in terms of effectiveness of the legal solution is useless for this reason in the corporate context in the industrial activities you can say we adapt the standards of strict liability strict liability means that the company typically is liable although there is not a fault but is liable due to the fact that has created a certain product or service that may enter some risk so if you have a chemical company you make business using chemical product of course but chemical plant can create a great problem if they don't work properly in terms of pollution in terms of environmental disaster etc you are liable regardless the fact that there is a fault or not you are liable because you have those that is in the best position to control the risk that you have created and put in the society you have a benefit from this risk you have to pay if they have negative impact of course what is the problem the problem is when we set the threshold because when we regulate the new areas for instance we can say oh there is no problem in terms of liability we put strict liability every AI producer is liable for all the damages that they create so all the systems have a person that will pay a lot of concern about the potential malfunctioning or problem created by AI system is solved because there are always some that pay but first if you adopt an extensive strict liability the impact is that many investors prefer not to invest in a sector in which they risk to be liable and the risk is higher if technology is new because it is less known in this side effect and there are a lot of aspects that should be still to be fixed so extended too much strict liability can have a sort of chilling effect on investment in the sector on the other hand if you rely only on the fault liability the risk that technology that is new potentially creates several risks of course at the end of the day there is no any person that is liable so increase the concern about consumer about the user about the citizen against this technology also this is not good because the people don't like are concerned they don't want to use so there is the risk negative react to the implementation and stop or slow the implementation of this technology for this reason we have to find the right balance between the strict and the fault liability and what is done for instance now the new proposal on the directive on AI liability that adopt some rules in terms of strict liability for AI producer but fix also some derogation to this liability for instance if you are complying with some standards the compliance of the standards is enough to say that you can run the library although the damage is created so is an example of balance you are strict liable so without fault but compliance with standard exempt from liability it means that you have an exit strategy focusing on the standard implementation that reduce your potential extensive liability other solution that can be also implemented are about the participation we can say in the game of other actors for instance insurance in the sector of drones not military drones but small drones for you can say personal use and in several countries there is mandatory insurance for those because they are cheaper with a few hundred euros you can buy a drone but flying and when they can fall down of course can create damage and also killing person and you are not necessary enough money to cover this kind of cost so like in the cars you need to have a mandatory insurance so create an entity that can pay this kind of damage that insurance system is another way to address the problem maintaining default liability but shifting the cost towards a company that on a large scale can mitigate the impact on the individual costs there is also the problem of privacy and watching people but the typical problem in which we have this liability is when the drone is flying that for malfunctioning or managing fall down from several meters and landing on the head of someone open and kill the person or open the car and destroy the car and so this is the kind of concern so the drones it depends by the dimension it depends by the weight etc but under certain circumstances can create damages to people and to goods and so for this reason some countries have required specific categories of drones some mandatory insurance of course if it is a small very tiny drones not able to fly to high etc there are exceptions but if it is a big drone with a couple of kilos of weight and fall down from several meters the problem exists this is the problem so insurance is a solution another solution for the big case is the role of the state for instance in nuclear in the nuclear power we have the participation of the state because the cost of the damages created by malfunction in a nuclear center can be so big that cannot be addressed by the company that manage the structure another point that we have to take into account when we fix the rules in terms of liability is that it is too simplistic to imagine that if you put all on the shoulder of the company you solve any problem because the company then bankrupt and if they bankrupt they first pay bank and other partners that have legal protection in terms of contractual agreement and for the last they pay the damages people so when there is a risk that the damages is so big like in the industrial and nuclear sector it is much better to fix a threshold imagine that the threshold the company can address and pay with their own money and for the rest imagine a sort of socialization of the cost through the intervention of the state because if you don't the only solution is that you fire the company and the company no longer pay the last in terms of priority for the credit that are damaged people so again another aspect that in terms of regulation should be taken into account ok here we have some reference if you like on digital society and risk society this is something that we already mentioned about the design these are examples of design in the Paris Boulevard that were big during the period of Napoleon III decided to destroy all the small streets and that was a by design approach because the large streets are much more difficult to be blocked in case of and it is easier for the soldiers to resist to any protects in the between the large streets or these devices that are by design approach in order to limit the car speed this is something that we already said yeah this is all about the by design approach but repeat what we have already discussed about the limitation of the approach and the impact of the by design approach so I want to move now to another set of slides that is about data ethics and data ethics is divided into parts we start discussing now data ethics giving some ideas and then we recall this idea of data ethics when we discuss after the data protection part about the AI because in the other huge debate about the regulation and the first part of the proposal between 2016 to 2021 we had a lot of focus on AI sorry a lot of focus on ethics and on data ethics as a means to address the challenges of AI so here we give only some general notion about data ethics but then we discuss more in concrete scenario we can say this issue where we will address the topic of AI regulation because for now is the only sector in which we have seen a proper debate an extensive debate about data ethics for the rest will remain mainly theoretical or legal debate at academic level but with AI we have the flourishing of ethics code ethics guidance etc. so we have a concrete implementation of the idea of data ethics so for this reason we discuss AI in the last part of the first part on the legal aspect of this course we reconsider the ethical dimension but before starting the next part with my colleague Giuseppe Vacciago who is very focused on data protection and he will just to highlight some general notion about data ethics because it is also useful to understand better the distinction between law and ethics that is also reflected in data protection regulation so if we look at ethics of course this is an image that can recall you the problem of the ethical use of technology and we all know that the problem that we use nuclear bomb in several parties of the world in the past and unfortunately something that was considered as from the past is now dramatically present in the debate about the Russian potential use of nuclear bomb although more limited but with always a very huge impact on population and environment so why I started with these photos because these photos usually represent the typical mindset that characterize the beginning of the debate about the ethics of technology because that ethics is a sub topic of ethics of technology such as data protection is a sub topic of technology regulation so we start for the main topic the main topic is ethics of technology in the ethics of technology the attitude was like the attitude that we have now so we are looking at the fallout so the fallout is something that is out of view is a technology that creates problem and rise issue and you discuss about the ethical dimension of this technology is ethical or unethical using nuclear weapons which kind of application they have etc by the way is the same discussion that we have right now with the AI powered application for workers similar debate about the ethical use of the AI powered weapons so why I want to stress this point that we have sort of external approach because this is exactly the first approach that was adopted in ethics of technology so the first stage of the debate of ethics of technology considered a technology of something that you can see you can judge if it is good or it is bad so typical debate on atomic bomb is it admissible or not is it good or not as a role of deterrence for this reason is acceptable or should have no any kind of role because kill people we never admit in any case the use of this kind of bomb so the technology is like an object an artifact that you look and you evaluate this is a typical approach that we have at the beginning so standard point of view technology as autonomous phenomena focus on the impact on society this was the first approach that we see in the debate of data of ethics and technology then we move to another picture in this picture what you can see you can see a bridge you can see a bridge this bridge is a famous bridge a serious if I am not wrong that were the Moses bridge the bridge created the Moses Moses was the architect that designed the Davenport the large part of New York in I think 50s more or less and the Moses bridge are very evaded topic because this bridge have a very peculiar elements they are very low the car can pass but the bus cannot pass under the bridge at the time the kind of bus that we are using so what was the ethical problem about the Moses bridge that this bridge was the position of this bridge create a sort of barrier in order to access to a new area of seaside where there were new beaches and these beaches are very close to the Bronx but people from the Bronx were not able to reach them because they cannot many of them are not private car and the buses cannot pass under the bridge so the bridge was a barrier for the rich people that come from the other neighbors passing through the eye of the road and arriving at the beach so for this reason but there is a very long literature for this reason some authors consider Moses as an architect driven by a racial bias in his design because by design you see the importance of design limiting the access to the black people basically or the poor people to the new beaches that were created so why I choose this kind of photo because this shows another approach to the ethics of technology or more correctly it shows another dimension another face of the relationship between ethics and technology because it's not no longer something that you look at but it's something that has a sort of circular relationship with the world to be more clear it's not the artifact that you look like a nuclear bomb but it's the bridge that you look but at the same time limits also your circulation so there is a mutual relationship the technology has an impact on society and the society has an impact on technology the bridge limits the black people to reach the sea but the bridge was done in this way because there was a racial approach in society and this racial approach is reinforced by the technology so in this regard the technology is not longer something that we look at and we consider it good or bad but we see also another important dimension of technology that is the fact that this interview is connected with our life the fact that we have some kind of design and technology impact for instance if you drive a car the change of the car is only on the right and if the right hand is not your favorite one this is a problem but nobody cares because the majority use the right hand and as a consequence the people that use the left hand typically in driving should learn to use the right hand as the main one and it is a change that technology induces in the behavior of these people but it is also a result of majority of the approach of the society so this mutual relationship between society and technology and technology and society open up to a broader view of ethics of technology technology is not only something that we discuss is good or bad but it is something that is much more complicated because it is the result of the society and is able to shape the society so there are two different and mutual relationships so I want to make sure that what you are saying is that the first approach is not fine for everybody for example, by any place is a semester for everybody but building a bridge can be fine for some people and not fine for others, right? not exactly I want to point out that there are two approaches and these approaches are in the time zone of evolution the first initial approach ethics of technology was simply look at the technology and consider if technology is good or bad but we don't realize that it is not technology that exists in an autonomous way it is not a technology that is good or bad and we as society that create a technology that can be good or bad so it is not a technology that is bad or is good but it is the value that we put in the way we shape the technology and another important step is that the way we shape the technology that we shape as a society for instance why a large part of Italian young people is no longer able to write a good text because they spend a lot of time texting in shamanic and they are not able to to write a good text and they spend a lot of time texting in short messages and in short messages of course the kind of communication is different and if you repeat the exercise for hours the usual messages in terms of communication of course you are no longer able to make an extensive text or it can impact on your ability to have an extensive text or if you consider also whatsapp for instance many of you probably record the messages and this idea to record the messages is a shift from the traditional writing culture in messages to the oral culture it is a change in parallel it is a change of behaviour of course and this impacts on the way in which we live consider another application google map a lot of people move around in a new city using google map for now this has no impact but in the long run you can imagine that a lot of information about the geography of the area will be removed because the people no longer look at the name of the street or look at the direction or ask the people but look at the smartphone with some silly effect sometimes but this means that google is able to reshape the way in which we shape the geography is dependent by the service but this impacts on society because if you have no access to the service if you have not a smartphone if you are poor people that have no smartphone you are not able to find the right direction in a space if the space became only smartphone base in terms of direction so this is an example how the way in which we shape technology then reshape the society technology is not neutral technology always embed a certain kind of view a certain kind of view for this reason we discuss about data ethics because also in digital technology in the technology based on data what we put is a specific view of the society we reflect our mindset so we can consider that it is great to have your direction in your smartphone why because they sell this kind of product of course being recently told that was great to have a chat search engine in order to provide a better interaction recover the fact that this interaction is not so good but what is the impact of society chat GPD approach is quite relevant in terms of ethical and social impact because right now if you are counting you have a list of sources we can discuss about how the sources are out lined if there is a bias or not in the positioning but we have the sources it means that if you want to understand you have to select and if you are well educated you are also able to select the right sources so if the top one is not so alternative and the second one is a big newspaper probably you start from the second one and not from the first one because behind there is a market oriented position in your own system but if you make a question and the answer is not a long list of sources but is a text that gives you the answer, combines these sources of course this makes hidden the sources how many people will check the sources if they have the answer only few will check the basis of this answer like when you read a scientific book if you are not an academic or a good academic you usually read the text but you disregard the footnotes but in the footnotes there are the argument and the the basis that justifies some assumption in the text if the footnote is wrong, if the content of the foot is not corresponding to the text it means that the text is not well grounded in terms of scientific reasoning but if the charge GPT search engine gives you the answer in a very good way and gives you the answer about for instance Donald Trump and the role of Donald Trump in society and in doing that a specific interpretation of the role of Donald Trump and gives you the sources but you do not look at the sources of course this change the power between you and the search engine because the search engine is no longer a list of sources but became a sort of oracle in which you ask and the oracle provides the answer and you trust in the answer how do people trust in the answer of Google when they ask for a street and they go in the wrong direction sometimes because the Google model in that case was not consistent with the last changes in the municipality for instance ok sometimes happens according to the map suggested by Google you have to go straight on and go in that direction but the municipality has changed the direction you have to stop but what about if this is the answer of the search engine that says something that is not correct you have to check it's different the search engine chat GPT power than an encyclopedia an encyclopedia has beyond a scientific work as a check, as a view so it's true that provide you an answer but this answer is tested by scientific experience by people in the field chat GPT search engine has not this kind of background simply select content and match content based on some parameters that are set in the machine but it's not a scientific output it's not a research output and this may change the way which society have access to knowledge and having access to knowledge is core element in democracy in research, many aspects of our society so this is just to figure out some real case or potential implication of the technology that we developed also in the field of digital technology for this reason is important as a computer scientist when you develop some digital technology do not consider only the technology aspect or economic benefits also legal constraint but consider also what is the impact of your technology on society what is in the medium and long round the impact of your technology in society because your technology can change society but we have to ask if this change is according to the values that exist in a specific society or if simply a stop down exercise in which a company or a big company try to shape the society in the way that is desirable for the company and we had some case that we discussed so the point the crucial point that is also represented by a theoretical approach that is the technology mediation theory the crucial point is that technology is not neutral when you design something you always design with your mindset we have made example of social platforms and the US values etc. or the Moses creatures etc. so the idea is that when you create some kind of technology directly or indirectly you reflect in this technology your view so for this reason we say that technology is not neutral so self-mutual self-mutual is a form of censorship when you talk about technology in a critical way so first the values are embedded second point is technology mediate between humans and the way in which the humans act in society this is the ideal mediation you see the things through technology let's give you an example if you consider the probate analysis all the analysis why because self-mutuals are known if you consider the checks that are done when you are pregnant before the birth of the kids of course right now with the ecography or other system it's possible to know a lot what was the effect on society that people can decide for abortion in some cases before was not possible yeah was possible abortion because you did not do the desire to have a baby but the abortion base all malfunctions on some specific disease before was not considered simply because was not technically possible to have that information but now that you have this information is possible to decide in favor of abortion based on medical evaluation we can say so the technology change the relationship between mother of the family and the future baby based on something that before was not possible this is an example of how we see true technology and the same is in the digital context you see the word through the search engine the search engine give you a list of content according to some criteria that are not the real world maybe there is a very interesting article that is published on a very minor journal that is the best one on the topic but the fact that the journal is not so well known there is not a lot of clicking there is not a lot of advertising this is not at the top of the results so technology mediates and the same is when you use smart cities or analytics to analyze society etc. you always provide a sort of description of the real world that is mediated through technology when you look at the map of the distribution of everything it's always a mediation depends by the parameters it depends by the variables that you consider the granularity that you consider etc. for instance if you look at the industrial activities and collect all the data through big data analytics and you represent this information at regional level at national level at local level the result may be very different for instance you can say oh in Piedmont there is a lot of activity in the industrial sector compared with the other region like Basilicata but then if you look at the Piedmont it's not true that in all the area of the Piedmont there is a lot of industrial activities there are some areas in which there is no any industrial activities so the different level representation of granularity give you a different kind of map a different kind of information and of course this change the perception of the society that we have and second point that is important to highlight that is the consequence is that if the values can be embedded in the technology including digital technology of course we have to check which value we are embedding in technology to check what it means it means that first we should be more aware about our role as creator of this technology for instance I think that I mentioned with you the case of the insurance that discriminated black people driving during the night we discussed I think that or not oh there was an insurance that decided to put a black box in the cars in the US and of course there are some parameters in order to reduce the cost of insurance or increase the cost one of the parameters was if you drive during the night or the early morning the cost is higher because usually you come back from a party you drink a lot of alcohol and this is not good for driving what was the problem that there are also people that driving during the night or early morning because they live outside the big cities and go to the big cities for work not exactly after a party and to clean offices and like that and by the way in the US this activity are usually done by black people or minorities and so this creates a discrimination and why the algorithm did not consider this aspect because it was created by may night computer scientists that never have the idea that you wake up in the early morning to have to clean something but they consider that if you drive in the early morning it's because you come back from a party because in their own experience this is the experience so of course computer scientists try to mitigate a bit this bias potential bias through having more by the group of design etc but it's not important that there is variety because if it's not the racial bias can be the color bias that exists the problem is to be aware that we can unintentionally reflect our mindset in the creation in the digital context so for this reason for instance important having participatory approach in the design including the user including the targeted because the target population can rise the hand and say oh I'm a black guy and you should not drive through the night because I'm just back from a party the idea is that when we discuss about bias, a large part of bias are not necessarily intentional bias, of course there are intentional bias, there are applications that are biased in favor to advertisers or in favor of some political approaches etc, it's possible but this is not the main risk the main risks are the unintentional bias the bias that are based on your mindset that you you can't detect because they are not able for you is normal and this is exactly the process in shaping society, shaping technology through technology reflecting values so if you consider that the black people should not go to the seaside with the white people and stay in their neighborhood of course the bridge is lower so you reflect your intention in the system and for this reason someone said that it was not a rational approach in creating the bridge, simply it didn't consider the fact that there are also black people that do not use cars but use buses so for this reason we have an ethical aware design and for this reason it's important a by design approach let's second about that we continue in the part after data protection I think that a key point that I want to highlight with regard to this slide is that the ethical approach make it possible to understand that not everything that is technically feasible is also ethically acceptable there are some things that are technically feasible you can make some analysis, you can use data in a certain way but it doesn't means that is also acceptable according to the value of society I can use brain scan in order to determine if you are follower or not my classes but it doesn't mean that brain scan is the best for you as a student's community in order to be good students at Polytech this distinction between technical feasible and societal acceptable, ethical acceptable is a very core element in terms of ethical design I think we have stopped is it correct? we continue, sorry we have not finished
