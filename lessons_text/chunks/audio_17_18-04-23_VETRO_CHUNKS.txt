 you you okay here we are good afternoon welcome to the second part of the course I kindly ask if you can if someone you can please close the door many thanks apologize for for being a little bit late but there is a technical problem with this screen and I cannot see the slides so but at least for the first part I will manage like this so of course this is 2023 my name is Antonio of a throw I will take part of the data ethics part of the of the course as you might have inferred from my previous communications on the web portal I am affiliated to the next center for internet and society it is an interdisciplinary center here Polytechnic which mixes perspectives from the social sciences and the human and the humanities with the classical perspectives of the department of control and computer engineering the Polytechnic with so with software engineering perspectives to study the impact of digital technologies on society the center is in its 16th year of life and it has some some particularities with respect to other traditional research centers it has a very strong attention to public dissemination to preserve the public interest when studying and analyzing digital technologies regarding to the dissemination activities that you can find on the website all our public activities at least two meetings every month are held and they're all public they are all open to everybody for for attending and I mentioned this because often there are intersections between the public events and what we discuss during the course so it's just an encouragement to to check out the website and activities of the centers there is also a main list there are two main list actually one is mono directional that means only the center is a broadcast main list only the centers can can write to this main list to be up to date to the events of the center and all other initiatives the other one that is the next is the reference point in Italy for discussing on digital technologies and society issues there are 900 actually about 900 subscribers that every day interact each other discussing and debating on topics on the general general subject of digital technology in society articles videos etc. the last month for example there have been a huge amount of exchanges and or really high value about chat to be seen for example and some of the people who interacted in the least were also interviewed in national newspapers and TV and radio and radio program and this is because in the least there are also influential people in the Italian landscape of digital technologies and society but also normal citizens that are that have a passion and an interest on the topics academics for any any discipline professionals etc. of course the only material for the course is the one that I will upload on the web portal I'm just mentioning this because this part of the course is highly connected to the activities of the next center so if you are if you discover that you like the top is this is one easy way to deepen the knowledge on these topics interacting with the next center of course on person also during the breaks or in any other occasion. Let's have a look to the organization of this of this part of the course the content from a high-level perspective is the one that you see in the web portal on the official sheet of this of this course we will see together starting from today fundamental concepts in data ethics we will make a few case studies problematics that needs to that that's a need needed and needs still today discussion broad discussion policy issues regarding data ethics then we will make a focus a specific focus on the problem of bias in software systems and bias in data. Especially in systems that are data-driven that are based on machine learning and artificial intelligence not exclusively not exclusively but especially because they are based on data and we're speaking about data ethics we will then exercise with statistical formalizations of a concept of equity that is called algorithmic fairness and then we will we will have a look together and discuss in class about the ACM code of ethics and professionals. What is the goal that I'd like to achieve with you? The first one is a basic goal of understanding the consequences of the data-driven software systems that you will design and implement in your future the consequences on society and to let you understand that choices that you are doing as software professionals and that you will do are not not only technical choices but they have an impact a concrete impact on the way that we live together and the second one is to that is a more difficult goal is to evaluate the impact of data-driven automated decision-making systems with a special care on vulnerable people. On those segments of society that have the most negative impact when these systems are implemented not in a proper way. What you see on the here on this triangle this pyramid is the so-called blooms taxonomy that is a taxonomy for that aims at categorizing educational objectives and okay the mic is not working properly battery off okay can you hear me yes is there any difference when I speak with the microphone okay not lucky today with the IT equ

ipment yes I was saying that this taxonomy is used to in order to classify educational goals with the first goal we are at the very bottom of the pyramid the first one is remembering that I hope I think that is something that you are already available able to do the second step in the taxonomy is understanding what you remember and this is what we are testing I am testing in the ad exam as a first goal and then you go up to the level of difficulty and the level of applications of what you have learned applying techniques and new situations analyze a certain phenomenal a certain a certain fact and then evaluate that is the level of the second goal in which you should be able to to judge a situation about a system and decide whether it is controversial from the ethical point of view whether it is improvable and how but this is what you are expected at the end to reach at the end of the course and we stop at this at this level the data is part is equivalent from the point of view of the score to the this is equivalent to the data protection part it is worth 15 points I remember that the exam is written it will be done on your laptop with your laptop on the exam platform so be sure that your your computer has the the latest version of the exam software and the lockdown browser is the way that you will perform the exam the data expert will be 50 45 minutes long of course notes are not allowed and you have two sections each one corresponding to these two levels one question on the goal of understanding and blah blah and one question on the goal of evaluating an impact the second question is a case or well usually I put it as a first question but is it connected to the case study is connected to the goal of evaluating the impact of automated decision-making system the second question is about theory so I want to test the level of your understanding of the of the subject each question is 7.5 points to make 15 points and 60 percent is the common traditional threshold sufficiency which means 4.5 points I tell this because the general rule that we apply in order to pass the whole exam so data exit data protection is to have at least well 18 but also three questions out of four that are sufficient because this is a course that mixes both the the perspective it is important that you show us that you have reached a certain amount of of understanding on both parts this is the the rationale behind are there any questions so far okay what are the evaluation criteria so I told you what are the evaluation goals what are the evaluation means that is open questions two open questions and how I will evaluate you according to these two criteria correctness and precision of the answers you need to be precise and of course to be correct and this is something that I always remind that only only what is consistent to the question will be evaluated so even if it is a open question you need to answer only to what is asked to the question every year I repeat this and I'm forced to repeat because many times often I see exams in which the students add further topics further details that are not requested in the question and I don't count them or even I can count them a negative in certain cases so please stick to the question this is important and then also since communication skills are very important in such topics the logical coherence of your reasoning especially in the case and the clarity of your argumentation will be a criteria of evaluation so you need to answer in a synthetic way and in a in a clear way it is clearly understandable because you are requested to reason to explain why a certain case is controversial what is a certain impact and you need to be precise and clear synthetic as I put in red this is not a traditional exam of x engineering where you are required to implement something or to apply some formulas there are also formulas but this is something different and let's have a look at the statistics of the exam providing that we don't have for some reasons that I don't know we don't have the statistics of the very first year are not available in the portal these are public data that you can consult also by yourself and so I took the statistics of the second and the third edition starting from the from the top you can see that we are about 50 percent of success which at the beginning there was this distribution of marks then last year was quite different because the central part somehow shifted both left and right so there were higher marks more people with higher marks but also more people with reaching just the the sufficiency thresholds is a little bit more than 18 as you can see there is here there are quite a lot of people with 20 but also a lot of people with 10 to 8 so I want to be positive however as you can see the rate of successfulness is raised but not so much I don't want to scare you I just and I know that covid and the remote as a remote lectures had an impact so probably this was this is also related to what we had in the in the in the previous years but this is somehow something that confirms that this is not a traditional exam of engineering where it is kind of challenging for you even if most of the lectures a

re discursive most of them will be even interactive will be like a debate take it seriously because otherwise you don't you don't match the expectations the learning objectives of this exam I can see from what I saw I can say from what I saw last year that attending the lectures in presence and participating with the lectures was clearly a factor of success clearly this was clear because of the nature of the course it is impart discursive and and not just passing some knowledge you are contributing to these debates somehow of course I hope that this year we have a further movement of the marks towards the right so higher marks so I can already see that there is much more presence so this is a good I think this is a good point how do you prepare for the exam for this not traditional exam of engineering slides as usual whenever whenever there is a further reading a text that is part of the exam I put it on the on the web portal and I clearly tell you that this is part of the exam and so you are expected to read I studied it everything is on the web portal then we will solve some exercises and past exams I will try to solve with you all past exams done so far all if if the planning of time will will be right mostly done in class so in case I will not able to to solve all of them in class you will be left with a solution also so you can you can check it at home the organization of this part of the course is quite linear we will have first all always theory and then starting from the 16th of May every Tuesday is exercises so these are the days the four days where we do exercises I will record all the theory lectures with the virtual classroom for me the virtual classroom is just a tool for recording the lectures it is convenient it is integrating to the portal I I'm not going to check the chat so right now even I cannot check the chat because display is broken so whatever questions will be made by chat I cannot see it so at this moment there is a virtual classroom active and I cannot see what if people is asking something and what is asking I'm not going to answer to those questions because this the blended lectures are over now lectures are in presence but I I understand it is important to have the videos of the lecture so I will provide them there might be certain portions of the lectures highly interactive where there is a debate and if I if I I see that the recording might let you be more cautious or more shy in interacting with me I might suspend the recording so that you are more free to express your opinion because whenever you you make a question so you say something it is recorded this is also an aspect that you should consider of course only students enrolled to the course can access the video lectures exercises I will try to record the explanations both at the beginning at the end but mostly these four these four appointments that you can see here are done without recordings for most of the time because it does not make sense why you are doing exercise to to to record in any case you will have a comprehensive solutions and explanations after the lectures so in case you're not able to come you know that in any case you can do it at home with the solutions I might signal you optional readings and I will I will clarify that they are optional but they help in any case in further depending the the aspects of the course well then of course to prepare for the exam you have to study at home regarding this last point and also to to increase the the level of let's say of care towards this non-traditional engineering course I remember you that the whole course is six credits this part of the course is free credits according to the academic credit system and how it is arranged at Polytechnic I remind you that one credit means 25 hours so if we consider let's focus only on the data expert if we consider the free credits means a 75 hours we are not making a 75 hours of lectures we are making 30 roughly 30 hours of lectures that means that there is a gap of roughly 45 hours okay this is bureaucratic stuff don't worry but it's just a way of dimensioning what is expected effort of course the productivity is different from person to person there are people that are able to to understand things just after practicing it or after having heard in the classroom and I'm not gonna recommend you to spend this amount of hours I'm just to remind you what the what are the official bureaucratic expectations about study at home okay do you have any question yes please raise your voice please they have several events and they can debate if these are in Italian or English about the public events most of them are in Italian but whenever you see that there is a communication with a title in English and with the now start in English means that the event is in English I make let me see if I can make a next well I'll show you only here I will not be recorded the next event if I'm not wrong should be in English let's check yes the next event that is next Wednesday at 1 p.m. it is ideal technologies ideal women looking at the redditor's AI and gender imaginaries of the replica chatbots by Ilyana De Ponti from University of Lofburg other questions oka

y I wanted to make this long introduction to the organization of the second part of the course in order to make your life easier of course to so that you have everything clear whenever you have questions also in the next class is about the exam just ask but remind to go back to these slides because I will strictly follow what I told you right now okay so let me switch presentation you you just a curiosity as far as you know did the display work with in the in the previous lectures or not you don't know okay so it Okay, now let's move yes please no I did yes I will I did some last minute changes and did not have the time to upload them during the break if I have time I will upload okay let's now move from the introduction of the bureaucratic and organizational aspects to an introduction more towards the the real contents of the course and we will have a look to do to the premises of this course of this part of the course the motivations behind this part of the course and so trying to answer to the question why are you forced to have an exam that covers data ethics let's split the question in two and let's focus on the on the easier part why data this is easier because I'm sure that you being a student of the of data science and engineering master course you well know the importance of data but let's just try to set some common knowledge together data is a strategic fundamental asset a knowledge asset for first of all for science and for policy making which is or should be based on scientific evidence it is since the first year of the new of the new century that the role and the quantity of data reached a relevant level in 2010 the economist made a cover that is the following one the data deluge why 2010 because these are the years following well in the late 90s the broad bandwidth viability of large of high speed connections at home basically in offices and then 2006 or 2007 the mobile phones that the iPhone was launched mobile connectivity had spread and these were together with miniaturization of electronic components these were the enables of a wide availability of of data and then we will have in the next years also many discussions among intellectuals and and scientists about the revolution of the so-called big data here you can see some examples of books involving economists and lawyers like this very influential book big data a revolution that we transform how we live work and think and as well data revolution even even philosophers Luciano Floridi one of the the most important philosopher of digital technologies which called the fourth revolution the one of big data in the scientific realm this this fact was pretty clear even earlier so nature published in 2008 discover the science in the petabyte era now we are much much more and during the years always devoted attention of scientists that was always devoted to understanding how making sciences science was changing due to these large and unexpected new availability of data there is there were even scientists who were acknowledging the end of theory that means that the traditional way of making science that is first you observe the world you make some hypothesis and you try to test them with some experiments and collect some data was reversed so you collect everything that every data that you can and then you extract you extract the facts patterns hypothesis and even theories from the data this was even a proposal of those years pretty limited I would say and you will discover later in the course why here you can say and in this in this slide a rough estimation provided by statista on the volume of data that is exchanged created captured copied worldwide and so this was done in 2017 so from 2018 on there are only forecasts but the trend is somehow even more with the with the newest data as you can say there is an exponential growth of the production of data from any type of digital of digital device we are in the era of zettabytes not petabytes like the science cover in 2008 in policy making this attention towards the importance of data was was pretty clear at the highest possible level of the institution so that it is the UN in 2015 the new UN goals were drafted after the millennium goals the sustainable development goals were created and were created after a process of course of review or reviewing the past goals and with ad hoc meetings called the high level panel on the post 2015 development agenda that is as I said the transitions toward the millennium goals to the sustainable development goals and as you can see in this abstract there is they were at the time have very high expectations about the possibility to track the advancement towards the goals with with data we can data from not only governments but international agencies the center for statistical offices the private sector a true data revolution that is written in the report of the working group would draw on existing and new sources of data to fully integrate statistic into decision making this is a very important passage because we have we have a connection of the knowledge gaining part knowledge gathering part with the action part with the policy making with a full integration that nowadays i

s visible on many many in many many cases so these are the sustainable development goals that I think you well you know well or at least you saw many in many times even this course is attached to one or more of these of these goals for for sure reduce the inequalities goal number 10 and if I will remember probably also peace just in the stronger institutions it is these goals are pervasive in institutions and as well also for for justifying the third sector and also in part also private companies justifying the actions of the of the third sector here's an example of the type of data that you can check by yourself on the dashboards of the advancement towards the sustainable development goals this is a graph on research and development expenditure as a fraction of the GDP when you have data as you can see it is quite shocking I would say that missing data is in practice out for the world enough for the world there is missing data about this these and other aspects this is a common situation that you that you will you will find thinking also to the most advanced technological nation the United States uh this is a structure from a report of 2016 from the national science foundation the biggest the biggest institution for science of the US government unprecedented opportunities for data-driven discovery and again decision-making in virtually every area of human endeavor again this this I'm stressing the expectations about decision-making that is what we will focus on here some high-level view from from 2018 on what are what is the perception from the global north or what is happening in China where technological advances advances on in data data-driven technologies and AI driven technologies are very well articulated and very well regulated by the central authorities China follows a different pattern of technological evolution what is this different pattern it is an evolution in which the state has an important role of orchestrator while in the global north we have a different pattern that is market-based where it is the markets that leads the technological developments and the state has to intervene at least in the in the current organization as few as possible uh according I'm just I want to describe you this this slide without going too much into details what is the China social credit score always according to the perception and the documents provided in states of the global north like the United States like Europe it is a system in which data is collected from a myriad of sources in data from both individuals and organizations in order to understand not only what are the the patterns of behavior but also in order to understand what could be the capabilities offered to people and companies what are these capabilities for instance access to getting a passport access to credit both for individuals and and and and companies in order to manage the best possible way the transition that is still ongoing towards the unadvanced economy which requires a large investment of capital so it is very important that in order to avoid the the bankrupt that we are witnessing continuously in the global north in order to avoid these situations data is useful in this in such type of system to control and make decisions at state level this is I wanted to stress the fact that I'm speaking about the perceptions from the global north this is China you and Europe and China and US are very very distant and they follow very different patterns of development and there are also geopolitical tensions so it is normal that what we see here is filtered somehow from the perceptions of our governments and vice versa expect from from powers that are that are conflicting at the moment that are conflicting each other so I'm telling this to give you first of all an overview of the expectations and the leveraging of data even in the highest possible level of institution and the regulation of the economy and of the technology developments but remember but also without any type of judgment of neither personal nor or any other type I'm not trying I'm not with this I'm not saying what is better or whether it is our way of development is better or the Chinese one I'm telling this because we will cover during the course very critical issues so it is important to stick to a scientific view on the facts so as you can see from the individuals you can see data from common administrative data data from from the web data from the business fair insurance data driving habits travel data telecommunication data workspace behavior integrated with data from the companies the product quality investments on r&d environmental offenses fulfillment of social commitment and so on the credit score gives availability and access to certain type of services having a phone contracts for example regarding having phone contracts is nothing that is very special to China also in Germany it has been investigated that some people were negated the phone contract because of their credit score it was built collecting data from basically from a large variety of activity including activity in the web this way of thinking is not new it has the roots on the past on the cybernetics revolution this is

 a sketch from the 70s on from the viable system model in in South America where you have again a different mode of organizing the productive forces the production of goods materials in which companies are organized controlled in large part by the state and collection of data helps at the highest possible level of state government to make to make policy as you can see here this is the plant level when you exchange goods you extract materials and so on you sell goods all this data in in the the planning of the viable system model where planned to be monitored and organized or presented from the then from the government in order to organize the economy something not you even in Italy this was a proposal in the 60s from a famous mathematician who is called the definitey who proposed the so-called the definitey board this is a system of interconnected databases from all possible sources of data regarding for instance the utilities water electricity electricity phones telecommunications post the official plants of the of the of the city but also police for instance the health system the welfare system the ministry of labor companies banks and so on the idea was to interconnect both private and public services and to give this amount of data to the first of all today is that that is the statistics of his main statistical office of Italy but also to government in order to do all to make policies we are very far from this from this sketch and even the I think it won't be possible these days to to have this level of interconnections with the private sector so this very cultural long cultural description of why data is important from the point of view of knowledge and from the point of view of policy making is as to be seen as a a must motivation and justification of the cases that we will see we will analyze welfare cases of automation welfare automation in the well in the health system and so on I think that it's time before opening the part on the economic level to have 15 minutes of break okay Dang Sche等一下 Okay, so data as a source of knowledge and as a basis for policymaking. This is the first pillar. Then second pillar, data as a strategic economic asset. It is more than 10 years ago when the time published this issue with a cover on your data for sale. It was, if you remember, the economist published the cover about the data deluge in 2010. So we were at the very beginning of this data revolution and the pattern at least in the global north was already clear. Data, personal data from people for sale. So a new market has been created and a market that in about less than 10 years will become the dominant market in the world. And the mechanism is pretty simple. You use a service most of the times for free because the product is you. And there are these companies that are not very well known, but they have a very important role, they play a very important role in the data market. Those companies are the so called data brokers who are the data brokers. Those are companies that collect the to buy data from different sources that about about you about my about me about everybody and integrate and then resell this data integrated with many other sources with some of course some profit margin because not only of the integration but also on the inferences that are done. Thanks to these wide and very deep data collection. We are speaking about data from what you are doing with your mobile phone games, etc. Of course, what you buy, not only online but also physically whenever you use your credit card or that that card you are producing data that is that is given to a private company visa is a private company that has the right to resell and with certain rules this type of data. Internet works and any other type of information. There is a huge market here and the result is data with with some economic value with some tags here in this this blog post that I use to to share with you this concept. You have what kind of inferences people with depressions for instance so that we can sell them certain drugs or we can expect them to vote to certain political parties. This is the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Psychological descriptions of the person were given in order to influence the voting of the people in UK. People who got recently married and so they may buy a lot of things. Women in pregnancy, there was a case many years ago about the prediction of the state of pregnancy from the exchange of Google mails from what you write. I think that if you ever noticed if you use Google mail that whenever you exchange a few mails on a certain topics then all in a sudden you start receiving commercials on rather on directly on Gmail or on the social on the social on social net or story on exactly that topic. If you speak on WhatsApp about pizza then you get the commercial of pizza on Facebook that is easy because they are both from from data and so on. So inferences categorization of persons and of their behaviors for any possible action and any possible sources. This is a huge market and this is an article from two, three years ago. If I remember, this integration is very, very specific and details. This is the level of information that can be ac

quired by two important companies in this sector that are data broker. One is Axiom and the other one that is more known for other products is Oracle. They are able to find to track precisely on specific person information on whether they are expecting parents or new parents, new movers, the bouts, a new house, credit the type of credit cards that they hold, the purchases, obvious interest, level of income. If you know where I live from the GPS then you can track with other types of data and you can somehow predict the level of income that you have. For example, number and age of children and age, gender, occupation, etc. What you purchased, what you are interested in, what are your political interests or attitudes, what you searched for on Google for instance. These are all traces, digital traces that we live often even when we are logged in a certain service and since we are logged in a service we give our consent to sell this data. This data is collected, integrated, recombined and sold again. Similar patterns you can see in Axiom. This is very similar to what we have seen with the slides on the Chinese credit score, social credit score system but on a different level, on a private company's level and with different goals. If you are interested in the topic, this is the first link and another one is here that you can dip. These are not links that you have to study for the exam just for your own culture. The phenomenon is so widespread that in 2019 an influential scholar in the US has written a book that is very long to read, it's very thick, the Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Soshana Zubov and you can have on the web also some reviews if you don't have the time to read the books and you are interested because it is a new form of capitalism that is based on data. Data about everything that we do, that is surveillance. Either state or market surveillance, it is still a kind of surveillance on us so that is everything that we can, that is done is tracked and is used to perform some kind of action. It is linked to a so-called actuator and actuator can be a decision on our service or prediction that then injects for instance a commercial advertising that is personalized to us. The data broadcast market is estimated to reach half a trillion US dollars in the next 10 years. This is a forecast and estimation but this is huge. This is a huge amount of money. Mostly by many types of sectors including government that is the dark blue, retail, bank, finance, insurance sector, this is the largest portion of this market, media. Most of these, so these are the percentages while this is an estimate in the next 10 years. What I show you is a computation of what happened in 2021 with some certain level of uncertainty this kind of distribution mostly on North American and Middle East and Africa. Connected to the data broker market system is the digital advertising that is roughly at the moment is this amount of billions of dollars, exactly the same amount that we have seen for the data brokers. There was a projection, this is real now, more than 500 billion dollars in 2021 and the trend is projected to be increasing. Just to have a comparison, this is in US, in Europe we are in a very different dimension. We are one fifth of what is spent in US for digital advertising that is based on data, less than 100. 20%, our market value in Europe in digital advertising is 20% of the market value in US. No comparison, so Italy is even less. In 2000, this is data from 2019, so real and then projections. We can consider roughly 3 billion euros in internet advertising. We might expand to the whole digital realm, we might let's say reach the 4 billion but is still quite a low fractions of Europe. This is 3-4% of Europe and I would say 0-5% of what is spent in the United States. The dominant players, take away message is in digital advertising based on personal data mostly is the United States. The most important players in the market of brokers are Asia and the United States. No traces for Europe unfortunately. Data is filling the most profitable companies in the world. This is data that is fresh from a few days ago. If you go to this website, companiesmarketcap.com, you can check by yourself public data on certain statistics of companies in the world, companies that are public companies, whose shares are exchanged in the market. You can have the market capital that is the value of the stocks, the total value of the stocks of the company. You can get data then on the revenues, the earnings, the employees and so on. In terms of market capitalization, the most rich company in the world is Apple, that is in the digital world. Part of its business is also dealing with data, not most of its business but part of it. We are speaking about $2.6 trillion. We will be back to understand the magnitude of this value in a while. Now let's focus on the companies, on this ranking of companies and on their geographical locations. Apple is USA. Microsoft is producing, as you know, most of the money comes from Office data from the working environments because of the Office suites, services to other companies, cloud services. Very soon, the GPT earnings because it

 made a relevant investment in the GPT in Open Eye, $10 billion. And we are over $2 trillion, sorry, USA. Then we have oil sector, traditional sector, Saudi Arabia and then we have alphabet, only data, Google, USA that is quite behind, it's half the value of Apple, Amazon, Logistic, but based on data services. And probably you don't know, but the margin, the earning of most of the earnings of Amazon doesn't come from the packets, that everybody, but from web services. Yes, very good, you know. It is not profitable, the most service. It is functional to kill other services to own that market, but it's not profitable for Amazon, that service. What is profitable is the, well, all the data related services and AWS. Then we have another, not a data company, but always USA, NVIDIA, not specifically on data, graphical processes, unit, graphical devices, but that they are very much used in the latest year for deep learning training. USA, Tesla, Digital Real, USA, Meta, USA, and then Johnson and Johnson, Pharmaceutics, not data, but USA. As you can see, the digital is dominating the whole economy today, the whole economy. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight out of ten of the first ten companies in the world by ranked by market capitalization and from the digital world. And most of them, they base their business on building value on the data that they acquire. Nine out of ten of these companies are from USA. So this is the reference in the digital world. And that's why most of our examples come from USA. You will find a couple of companies between the 11th and the 20th position from China. And one company from Taiwan, production semiconductors. And one company from the Netherlands that provides the machines to write the chips. But except this, no other companies from other parts of the world. So the digital world is made in USA. This is a fact. I'm not saying it's good, it's bad. I don't have an interest, but I don't share this here. This is a fact that you should take into account. Now let's go back to the magnitude of this data. This is so Apple, let's take Apple. This is two thousand and half trillions of dollars. What is this? This is more than the GDP of Canada. That is in the G8 data from for September, two thousand and twenty two is more than the GDP of Italy. Of course, annual GDP. But this is we cannot really compare the two things. But if Apple is ranked, is injected in this list, taking its value of its stocks, just of its stocks, it will be in the G8. So this makes this data that I wanted to show you makes very clear the balance of power that today is. As to be taken into account when we speak about regulation. Of the digital market regulation of the digital world in a broad sense states have to deal with the private companies. And the same way that they had to deal with the forces, let's say, of the oil companies, the pharmaceutical companies. The tobacco companies in the past. Of course, these companies have their own interest and they will try to preserve this power, economical power that is in turn is a political power. I want to let you reflect on a fact during the pandemic when the states were trying to develop. Apps for contact tracing that could not that could not set their own standards standards, the technical standards were not set even by. Let's say a technical organization, international organization like the ICO, the like the IEEE. No, they were set by Apple and Google stop and stop it. Digital, the app for contact tracing, they were possible only. According to the rules set the technical rules set by Apple and Google. Because they provide the operating systems for the form. This is the power of the other of the other private companies of these giants, the web giants, the tech giants. And this has to be taken into account. Always in all our reasoning. About the digital data world. You if you play with the data and if you check the same. The same website in the past, there are services that let you. See the content of a website during the past. And I can provide you the links if you want. You will notice two facts from the latest three years. First of all, during the pandemic, some companies doubled their value. If you check the value of Microsoft before pandemic is around 1 trillion 1000 trillion, sorry, one trillion dollars. Yes. So the pandemic made part of the population much, much richer. Unfortunately, a very tiny fraction of the population that is that is connected to these companies. The second fact that is still not clear why. Is that if you rank these companies by employees and then you check the history, you will see that there is a decrease. A decrease of the number of employees in the in the sharp decrease in the digital sector. It is not clear whether this is a bubble that was created during the pandemic. Or there is something else going on. The new level of automation, it is possible replacing the people. Or a shrinking of the digital market is still. This is too fresh to to to get a clear understanding on the phenomenon, but this is a meta fired a consistent number of people. We're the same when Elon Musk came into the board. Microsoft is doing the same. So this is where the. The pr

emises for answering why data, why that is so important. I'm sure you knew that this is important, but I wanted to give you some numbers. Some facts. A short of a bit of history of the latest 20 years to understand how we reached this situation, which data is fundamental to the data. Why do we need that? And this is the second part of the of the question. Let's break the monotony of this of a traditional lecture now by asking to you what is it according to you. So I will now let me. Let me first of all. Go to the activated the survey. And if you want, I asked you to tell you your own words. This is anonymous. What is what is ethics? I will wait a few minutes that you connect and then I will activate the survey. Let me do like this. Just a second. Oh, that's a second that I share again the code from the presentation. Okay. Should be active. Let me try. Okay. Yes, it's working. I. I gave this question a few months ago in an activity with students from high school. The very first year of high school. And. From a side that there is that was very interesting from another side, people starting to write whatever came into their mind into the answers. Including insults. There were students launching insults between themselves. So please don't play because I cannot control. That was quite embarrassing to show the results in front of the of the teachers because results can are shown in real time. So. I will wait a few minutes and then I will investigate on what is European or about what is a tick. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then the number is quite stable. No, it's freezing. So, but we can start at least checking the world cloud and then a few answers. So, ethics is right. That's that's okay. I see wrong. Let me. Let me comment. Can you see the mouse? Yes. Okay. Perfect. So wrong and right. Yes, ethics is it is about what is wrong and what is right. Society. So, ethics is connected of course with society what is wrong with the respect to other people. And that means that has both at an individual level and a collective level, a collective dimension. It can be about rules. Yes. There might be rules and it is a branch of philosophy that's right. It is about moral. Yes. It is about moral, moral behavior. It is about I'm just checking the most common words and then we will switch to the definitions. It is personal. It can be connected with justice and you're right. It is right. What is wrong. And if you do something wrong, you might also have to deal with justice. Different ethics is something that can be different from person to person from society to society. And that's the aspect because culture plays a very important, important role. There are ethical principles. Yes, in a certain in a certain dimension of ethics and normative ethics that we will see in a while. It is wrong. Okay, behavior. Yes, of course, it is about what we do. And according to consequentialism, it also about the impact of what we do the consequences of our actions. Super, super, super. This is exactly what I feared, but not not not at the level of the high schools. I knew that. The principles that regulate, well, it's 6pm. That is fine to have this kind of stuff late in the day. The principle that regulate interactions between humans that live in a society. Okay. Good. Education respect to each other and discipline put together, not always discipline. But isn't a good direction act according to morality. He's a bit circular because morality is also connected to ethics. A collection of behavioral guidelines shaped by cultural socio-economic characteristics and the history of people very good. No, sorry. They're the wrong. Doing things in favor of social norms again that the collective dimension. I think you, you were, you are very aware of it. A set of oral axioms that define or imply what's right and what's wrong. Very, very good. Values. Yes, can be a certain type of ethic can be inspired to values. Virtues. The right thing to do according to society or a personal opinion. It's more than an opinion. It's a person that are not placed by government instead they are personal rules controlled by personal missiles. It is to be influenced by cultural religion. They are not only individuals rules, let's say, they can be also norms, ethical norms that are established by communities. It may represent social values. The ground between good and bad. Yes. Awareness of the impact of certain choices in the instruments on the society. Yes, at least according to consequences that will define in a little bit. Norms should guide what's right and what's not in order to live in a better society. We decided to say that but what are the right or wrong way of thinking way of doing for humankind usually it is about action, not thinking about about the actions what you do, not what you think. The principles you have to set up to make a good legislation that preserves human rights. This is very specific ethics is not by construction. You have to link then it is linked to human rights and from a very high level way. Yes, also to legislations but not in a mandatory way. And Zupa Zupa and that's and that's okay. I think that you have a very good and clear idea of what is ethics. Le

t me go back to the of, but we still need a common definition that I give you from the Cambridge dictionary the study of what is morally right and morally wrong or a set of beliefs while what is morally right and morally wrong. So, it is a discipline or philosophy that helps humans individuals in society to understand what is good, what is right to do and what is wrong to do. We have several types of ethics. I just wanted to point you to the type of ethics that we deal with mostly we have meta ethics that is about investigating what are the origins of ethics and the meaning of the ethical principles. We are not interested into this. This is not a philosophy course. We could be interested in applied ethics that is examining specific issues very specific issues, human reproduction animal rights, nuclear war and so on. We might touch some very specific issues, but we are mostly interested to into normative ethics. That is developing some principles, or knowing at least with are the what can be the print ethical principles that should guide our behavior, but not our behavior as individuals, our behavior as software professionals. We have the ethical principles and norms that can guide us in the constructions of data driven software systems that takes decisions instead of us or that helps us taking decisions. So, software automation is very pervasive and is touching the very way in which we are interacting with each other, the very realm of our opportunities, what we can aim in our society, whether we can get access to credit, whether we can get access to welfare services, for instance. And it is very important given the level of software automation driven by data that we set up some norms of of behavior in our work. There are several several strengths of disciplines in the normative ethics. One is consequentialism already mentioned that one is them to all of you that one is virtual ethics will deal with all of them. So, consequentialism is understanding what is right or wrong based on the consequences of certain actions of consequence of certain specific characteristics of our system consequences of the of the actions of the software system and with us. The ontology instead defines. It's like a top down approach defines what what are the principles that we showed the in the very first moment in which we are software professionals to obey this. And we should guide our actions and our duties as software professionals. We will read at the end together at the end of the course, the ACM code of ethics, that is the code professional code of ethics for, for software engineers. And this is the ACM code of ethics is belonging to a don't logical approach to normative ethics. We will study statistical formalizations of fairness. When a software can be can be defined as fair or not. And this is belonging to a consequentialist approach to ethics. We might reflect on other aspects of fairness, fairness based more on values. And this is an approach to virtue ethics that belongs to virtue ethics that focuses on our, our virtues. And these are the values that you pursue individually and as groups of people and that are implicitly most of the time implicitly embedded in software systems. And why we are dealing finally can we we can answer to the, at least from a theoretical point of view to the questions why are we dealing with with data ethics. Because there are a number of problems or data driven systems that belong to the following characteristics. Epistemic concerns that are arise whenever the predictions of use of the system the classifications of uses of the system are either not reliable. From a statistical point of view, for instance, are not inspectable are not screwtable. Can we have a look for instance to the training that data or check GPT. No, this is a fact. I'm not saying that we should or we should not but given the impact of this tool that is a data driven tool. Maybe, maybe we should, we should start debating this, this question, but we should able to inspect the training data of system that has a huge impact on the way in which we work and we live. Or wrong evidence, wrong predictions totally wrong predictions. The Netherlands Prime Minister had to resign a couple of years ago because of a scandal of software automation that was wrong. That was asking back to 1000 1000s of families asking back money for welfare assistance at the gold for their children, because the software automation was wrong. Was was doing wrong inferences. Then it was it was related. This is something different but had to resign. So the automation of software based on data is reached a level that is quite important for the way we live. And other group of problems ethical problems unfair outcomes outcomes that are different based on age of people based on the ethnic group they belong to the nationality. So the same software is making a disparate impact. This is the right term based on personal characteristics. But if I automate the selection of candidates and then analysis of the results of my CV screening tool show that I discard with the higher frequency women rather than men. This is a discrimination that is punishable by law. And these are real c

ases. Or if I show more often advertising about a job offer or our house renting offer. More often to white people rather to black people. This is a discrimination. These are real cases that will be studied. So these unfair outcomes. These are category of ethical problems. And that they can lead also to transformative effects because we change reality deny opportunity to people based on their personal characteristics. And we have transformative effects on the life of the individuals but also on the evolution of society. And the last group of problems that will not touch a lot during this part of the course is trust ability that who is responsible for what. If chat to be the says that I am a thief who is responsible. We don't know, but it is say something false a guy about myself. And if chat to be T is used inside a pipeline that gives them it is connected to some certain so some automated action automated decision. This is a huge problem because I cannot track the chain of responsibilities. This is just an example from very recent cases. In Australia, a major was. He was a sweet it open AI because of false information about himself. The GPT said that he was involved in a scandal. tax. tax scandal. A professor in US was told by chapter to be involved in a sexual harassment scandal. The possibility is open questions open problems. We are at the very age of research and social debates. So this concludes the premises we are just the premises of data ethics. So to to to some up we have seen the data are fundamental asset for policy making for economy. Among the most important pillars of our of modern societies. We have seen the power of the of the big text that is huge that is equivalent to certain cases to a power of states and we have to take into account this fact. And then we started to reason about what is ethics and how. What what kinds of general problems we will face. In in data ethics. Okay, I will not make a second break. But I will finish soon. I want to just to start the next set of slides that we will continue not on next Monday. Lectures cancel it. But on the second of May. I already uploaded the oldest lights. Of today and now the second May. I want to use a let's say 10 minutes to set up a few concepts that we use during the course and then you're free to enjoy the rest of the day. Impact of software. Do you know is Mark Lowell Anderson. Yes, very important venture capitalist was the among the founders of Netscape at the beginning. Then I enter it makes a lot of money and the board of invested in LinkedIn successful companies like LinkedIn, like Twitter. He sits in the in the board of meta is listed in the wall of fame of the W3C org. The W3C organization is a is someone who have a long term vision on the digital world. In 2018 in this interview was this journalist so he said something that today for us is is quite say it's nothing new that software is hitting the world that means that there is a chip and there is a software or at least a firmware everywhere. Plains, your watch, if you have a digital watch, I don't, but maybe someone you has to a fridge, even TV smart TV smart X, whatever is smart means as a software. Whatever is marks means also tracks some kind of data from you. And that was 2011 was not not obvious at the time and then five years later say that something again was visionary software is programming the world that is about the transformative and software. So the solution is becoming a pervasive not only software, but also acts actuators that are linked to directly to software software takes decision instead of us and gives shape gives distribute opportunities, rewards, penalties to people. And besides instead of us. A lot of things. And this is the era of artificial intelligence as you well know. I will take for the rest of the course definition of artificial intelligence. This is given by to influential persons who are. Stuart Russell and Peter Novig, one of them is director research at Google. And in their book artificial intelligence and modern approaches is used in thousands of universities and hundreds of countries. They depict the landscape of artificial intelligence systems with this quadrant. These are systems that can focus either on the action or on the knowledge on the way of organizing knowledge. And they can be evaluated either against human performances or ideal performances. So our robotic armor is in this in this in this quadrant that it is focused on action and the measure of success of success is it should act like a person. And then we can have a different criteria of success that are that is what is the goal towards which we develop our system can think like a person should think rationally. Think like a person maybe let's say an example, you should recognize images or semaphores like a person and this is the success criteria for these types of artificial intelligence systems. They should organize knowledge instead in a in with respect to different criteria they should act. With respect to ideal performances. We're interested in the act rationally quadrant. The tea that is smart agents that acts with respect to an ideal performance that is given by who buy the softwar

e designers. The smallest unit of a system is the agent agent or smart agent is an agent that perceives information from their environment, including other agents and acts according to this information towards the environment. A keyboard is an agent. Everything is an agent with this definition. It perceives some kind of information and produce an action. The agents function for an agent specify the action to be taken according to the data that it receives. Let's say the performance measures evaluates the behavior of the agent in a given environment. So an agent that is able to perceive the the brightness that is outside this room. It should be designed in order to really perceive to a high level of accuracy. What is the real brightness out there in order to automate. For instance, the cartons to make the room darker or brighter. A simple example of intelligence system and it should so designed to maximize these expected performance performance measure. This is what you do when you train you build a model towards a specific measure of performance. So this is a graphical representation. They were a certain kind of sensor something that perceives from the environment, including persons. It is translating to data. Operated by algorithm and then an action is taken back to the environment. We have systems that are distributed. That means that they can exchange information with other systems in different locations. And they are called social technical systems because people are involved. An example of a simple social technical system is the for instance the telepath systems in Italy in the highway. So if you recognize your plate, like you're plating your car, it connects to another system to check whether you are allowed to pass or not. And then it has an actuator. It can allows you grant you the passage or not, and then needs to be connected to accounting system. These are the characteristics of our of agents say agents that are are are defined like this. They are autonomous. They can take decisions that can act autonomously. They can adapt to the environment that can be trained. They can be retrained for instance, they can adapt to changing requirements legal requirements for instance, and they allow interactivity with people or without other agents. So these are the three the three fundamental characteristics of agents. A particular type of agents is are automated decision making systems. They are systems that can They are the composed of the following parts a decision making model. The algorithms that implement the decision making model. That assets that are used mostly to train the model or to define a certain set of rules. Whatever is around them that's had an influence on defining those rules that is the old political economical social ecosystems that determine the rules. The performance criteria that should be used to design the system and so on. They are used today in every possible imaginable aspects of our life predict whether you are going to marry the or not or where you're going to live with someone else predict the risk of violence at home, especially children in Denmark. For example, suggest certain cases even decide whether you should change a major in your university course, or whether you should enroll somewhere else. Identify best suitable candidates for job position that used a lot. The text social welfare frauds in the Netherlands. The content from a social network and so on so on. So every possible aspects of our lives is today mediated by by automated decision making systems. Usually, most of the times they are developed by private companies for government authorities. So there is a strict collaboration between state actors and private private companies. They're even used in the current work, not work war Ukraine Russia. Palantir is providing assistance to Ukraine to perform some data driven analysis and support decisions. Whenever we have a machine learning systems or I systems that are used in a in a. In automatic decision making we speak also about all the predictive optimization that is the meeting point between AI ML applications. The automating of decisions on people. And the act of classifying forecasting, labeling something the union of these three things is. ML AI based automated decision making systems that makes predictive optimization. This is a term that we use. A few statistics and then I will conclude. It is according to this. Are they made by happy Germany and then graved by by statistic. It is that the decision making systems are used mostly in the banking and insurance sector. This is also the dominant face sector. If you remember in the data in the data brokers market. These are where decisions are mostly automated. But then any other sector is moving towards a to make automation of decisions. Telecommunication company, healthcare automotive energy utilities, public services as well. And so on. The reasons. Are making things making decisions faster. The most cited reasons, at least the form from this sample of about 1000s of managers is not representative about the gives a rough idea. Perform better business operations. Develop new product services. These are the three. Most mentio

ned reasons to to automate the decisions. So basically to to be faster. A recent analysis of the most instead of the most real concrete. The data with the system developed. Highlighted that. What is marketed what is. Offered by the companies is a higher accuracy in the prediction outcomes to have better results. Better fairness across individuals. And so. Fair predictions and classifications on humans, rather than whether the decisions was left to solely on humans. And then efficiency so fast, faster decisions. And once these expectations are not met, I anticipate to you, so we still have to work on a on an ethical way of producing this kind of softwares. Because of the very fundamental epistemic in which the systems are based. These systems works all systems works. Only if there are data, if there are enough data, lab data. Unless is a supervised training, but. Let's, let's stick to the most used. AI systems most spread. Diverses data. And data notated by someone with the right answer. These are the principles of all inductive processes, all processes of inferencing something some information based on data. And if these characteristics, it is much, much harder to have a good model that works very good. Let me check whether I should go on or not. Let me go on and just just to finish the slides and then next time we will start with the concrete examples. When I speak about inductive inference. It's a very particular type of inference. That is complementary to other two types of interest one is deductive. The deductive instance inference is the traditional way of inferences is the way that we follow it for for in the whole history of humankind, but basically to to structure our knowledge. All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. So deduction. Socrates is mortal. So this is the way of deduction. Logical inferences starting from from some facts rules and then we will deduce we infer some other facts. Then inductive we start from data. I observed that I know that 90% 96% of Flemish college students pick both Dutch and French. This is a Flemish college students. So I have a quite high probability that Luis speaks both Dutch and French based on observed probabilities. And then abductive is a bit of a mix of the two. But the implies also causation. So I observe something. I give explanations. And then I infer based not only on the data but also on the explanations that they gave and explanations are based on some type of knowledge that is structured according to deductive inferences. So it's a mix of the two. And it is really really a personal human characteristics machine cannot at the moment to do. Well, they can do deductive inferences and they can do inductive inference at the moment they cannot do abductive inference. Well, a DMC stands based on data and machine learning. I are inductive. They make inductive inferences. They have certain characteristics. We can go there amplitude so that we will reach we collect some data and then we can go beyond the premises that are containing that data. And then we can even infer from a subset of elements to the general set of a given populations. So this is a very theoretical, but just to fix this important concept that we're speaking about inductive inferences and that they have some problems, important problems whenever we try to predict what social outcomes. Outcomes on the life of people. This is very interesting, but I think it's better to do next time that is the second of of May. Have a nice evening and see you on the second of May. Thank you.
