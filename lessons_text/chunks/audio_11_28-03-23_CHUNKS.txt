 Sorry for the delay, but I was discussing with your colleagues about the potential use of charging computers. Okay, so let's continue with another case. This is the case of smart suits and not so complicated terms of data protection. Part is interesting because it's a case of robots human interactions in which they use some sensor put on the body, in order to know the position of the person. And in the past few days you can see the interaction with the robot. Of course, this is not only a matter of data protection. Of course, you might collect some data because they know the specific data. It's much more a problem of safety and security, of course, because the interaction with robots can entice a robot with related to the position of the person. And again, this is based on information about the place in which people work. Now, let's change the scale and let's consider large scale projects. In the case that we have just discussed, the dimension was quite manageable, we can say. And typically we focus on only one specific application. The fingerprint to identify the person, the other scale term, workstations of very contextual application. In other scenarios, the key feature is the complexity of the scenario. And this is typical, for instance, in the case in which we use digital technologies in smart environments and smart cities. In this area, we have not only one application, but we have a merger of different kind of applications and in many cases an interaction among these applications. So if you download smart cities, you download systems to control the traffic, to share the bike, to control environment, to control energy consumption in the houses, to provide citizen platform for exchange of ideas, participatory government, etc. All these activities created this smart environment. And while in the past these activities were in many cases the result of progressive add-on and design. Now, there are new models that relate only the effect that is called platformization. Platformization means that there is provider that give you the platform to manage all these different kind of activities that are embedded in the platform. So a central backbone that connects all the features that are managed in the city. And on this platform, of course, there is the provider for the bike sharing services, the provider for smart houses, the provider for another service. But it's the platform that connects everything and at the same time that rules everything. Of course, this in terms of data protection, it makes much more complicated assessment of potential risk. Because it's no longer the risk of each application, but it's also the risk of the community effect of this application. Because I can consider the risk of modular traffic, I can consider the risk of modular the platform for civic engagement. But what about if I merge this information, I know where you go and I know what you think about the city management and all that. Of course, i

ncrease the number of information that I have and the influence that they can extract, merge in different points, different information in this system. So the platformization has several concerns. In terms of data protection, decentralization in a platform of several information that can combine to provide much more insights about people. And then interaction with the other people. It's not only the individual level, but it's also the societal level. If you create a smart neighbor, you can have information about the habits and the interaction of the people that live in that area. Not only the single person, but the group in itself. So there is also another dimension, typically data protection, we have the individual dimension, but here there is also the group dimension that is relevant. Because you can monitor how the people in that area live, for certain extent. And this is an impassive in terms of group. Because you can infer information and based on this information, you can decide to adopt some strategies. For instance, in crime control, all the predicting policy system are based on this kind of technology. So for this reason, the large scale project entails a lot of concern if you want. There is a potential impact that they may have on individuals and society. And... It's an example of data security. And so it's the risk of high professor control. And then there's another dimension that is important, the platformization usually, and there is the engagement of private entities. And if you look at some famous case like Toronto in Canada, the problem of the engagement of private entity is not per se an issue. Of course, private entity provide a lot of services. But the critical aspect is the shift from the public power to the private power. The case that is quite well studied is the case of sidewalk, this is the rendering of one of this area. Sidewalk in Toronto was a part close to the port, that was an industrial area. That was transformed in a smart environment. And to do that, they make a public procurement and the alphabet Google society win the public procurement and became the entity that provide this platform to create the sidewalk to Toronto area. And what is interesting is that the fact that they manage all these aspects concerning traffic, buildings, efficiency, social interaction etc. They have the power to organize all this stuff. And for instance they can enter in house and put sensor or remove sensor, activate or deactivate sensor for energy consumption, energy monitor etc. So the environment, the technology environment was in the end of a private entity that can shape this environment. Of course this is a shift from the traditional paradigm in which the social environment and the territories managed by public entities, by region, by state etc. Now through the platformization became something that is managed by private entities based on contract and using private power. Not through a democratic process. If

in your municipality the manager decides to change the way in which the car pass through the city center, the people can go to the manager and say oh we don't want that, we vote you etc. So there is a typical interaction in the context of public role. Here is a private relationship. So it's a company that organizes service, you are a client of the company, you have to respect the contract and the contract fixed on rules about your social life. So aspect that are in the sphere not of private but in public sphere. So the platformization was highly criticized also for this reason because there is a sort of privatization of the typical public function of the public administration. It's not a problem of the shift of the function from the public to the private but it's a problem of the fact that this shift may possible to lack the control that we have as a citizen on the public sphere. And we have no this control when we become clients when we are simple like contractor, counterpart in the system. So this is a change in the program. And this is not about data protection but it is about the government in general and the impact that this partnership with private companies may create for this reason. So this was one of the reasons for the lack of success. So this is the favor of this project in Toronto. And of course for the data protection perspective, when we use the landscape project, we have to consider that it's very important to have an approach that takes into account the world project. And the relation between the different parties. If you want to create a project that is a large-scale project, you have to keep in mind that all the parties are connected. And in this sense of course in the Axis project there is some design in this project that wants to adopt these all but I'm a process only anonymous data. And they overestimate sometimes the fact that they process anonymous data because more data you collect, more extensive the environment, the data environment that you create in terms of interplay between different services, much more difficult to demonstrate that the data are anonymous. Because you increase the risk of identification because you merge many different services that at individual level can be also anonymous but marginal together can reveal further information. So in this sense the first point is that you cannot say that you have anonymous data if you have not carried out an assessment of the risk of identification. So the fact that data are anonymous is okay but you have to demonstrate also that you are not able to re-identify the person. And sometimes this is not clear, people think so. There is no name as to the names of anonymous, that's not anonymous. Anonymous is when there is no easy to re-identify the person. And we have important cases for instance the Ministry of Health of the New York State that provides an open data as anonymous data. And then some scholars re-identify the 60% of this data. And of

course this demonstrates that they are not enough anonymous. And so in this sense the access strategy of many projects that will relay on anonymization should be careful managed because sometimes it's not possible to have full anonymous data. And the second point is very important to have as I said a whole picture of the system. And in this sense a tool that can be used and which is not in the GDPR is the data manager plan. The data manager plan is something that is used in large scale projects. In the GDPR there is no this kind of tool. But it's very important because there is a plan in which you map all the processing operation and the connection among the processing operation and those that are involved. So if you look back to this idea of the smart cities you have information about the fact that you collect data about the bike sharing services, about smart mobility for public means of transportation, about car sharing. And this is for mobility. And then you collect information for citizen participation on the platform for citizen engagement. And you collect information from the system of education, etc. So you have a map in which all the clustering information are identified, the flows and the interaction on the flows. This is the only way in which you can control, we can say, and what you are creating in terms of that environment and can also monitor the potential risk of this data environment. This is important in terms of data flow but it's also important in terms of monitoring the task. Because as you know in terms of data protection but more in general in terms of management, it's important to define the task. So when you have a flow it's important to define who can use this data for which purpose it can be shared without a person or not. For instance, you have a smart city system for traffic management but typically this information is not only for traffic. It can be also used by the police department in some cases or it can be used by the administration not for traffic reason but for pollution analysis, etc. So the same stream of data can be used by different actors and you have to define the authorization, the profile, who can access for which purpose and under which conditions. So much more complicated is the environment, much more or the task should be the definition of the task of the people involved. And the third point, you have to consider that in many cases this kind of large-scale services are under Article 35. It means that you have to carry out the data protection impact assessment because of large-scale processing because you can look at some key fundamental rights. And also in this regard it's important to keep in mind that the data protection impact assessment typically is focused on the specific processing operation. So you carry out the data protection impact assessment and we regard for instance the system for smart bike or the system for citizen participation. But if this is an ecosystem, a dig

ital ecosystem, we have to consider also the cumulative effect in terms of risk. So the risk in all the systems that are composed by different elements, there is not the risk only for the single element but there is also the systemic risk, the cumulative risk. Like in a car, etc. There is a problem with the wheels, not the problem with the wheels but also for the entire car. So in this sense the data protection impact assessment should be also made at aggregate level. So combining the risk, the sum application may entail for other kinds of applications, for other kinds of use. And also the merge related to the synergy between the applications. And finally it's very important to have a sort of homogeneous approach to some key issues like for instance transborder data flows or consent procedure, etc. Because in a complex system, as a market resistant, typically you cannot imagine an effective interaction if the standards are different. For instance if there are some applications that process data only in Europe and applications that share the data outside of Europe and they cannot merge the data. Because one can go outside and the other not. So you should define some common policies in terms of data sharing, data transfer, data retention, etc. And also a common procedure for instance for consent or other, or modification, other obligation in order to facilitate the life of your citizen. Because you cannot have to deal with hundreds of different kind of forms in order to provide consent for the smart cities activities. So a level harmonization is necessary. For this reason when we deal with the large scale system and large scale project, also in research, this is about smart cities. But the same is if you make an adult project that Europeans scale with many different entities involved in different hospitals that collect data, etc. You have to harmonize the system in terms of a uniform approach and create templates that can be used by all the entities in a similar way, not to complicate the flows of data collection. Another important point is that it's not only a matter of GDPR compliance in many cases and typically it's tax distribution, etc. But it is also a matter of compliance with the specific context requirements. Because it's true that there are some general rules like in the GDPR in Europe. But at the same time we have to consider also the context. For instance there can be some specific restrictions at the local level for using some data, etc. And this should be considered. You have to take into account some local restrictions or some local desires. People can't want to have some services in some way rather than another. So the context analysis is always important. I'm going to finish this. There's a big game. Of course when there's a large scale project, what we have seen in this small scale project that is in effect on the individual is broader and is no longer a matter of data protection. But there is a problem of

many other different rights that can be potentially affected. For instance in Asmar cities, monthly traffic can be used in order to monitor the people that participate in some assembly or other activities that have political relevance. Or monitor the interaction about the citizen participation platform can reveal some political position or some connection among group of people, etc. And monitoring the energy consumption can reveal information about the people if they live in a specific house or don't live, how many people live there, etc. There are many inferences that can be extracted and impacting on several rights that are freedom of movement, freedom of thought, free association, etc. So in this sense the impact is no longer limited to the concern in terms of data protection, but also other rights should be considered because we of course consider the nature of the course if we focus on data protection. But also the other rights are protected. If you create a platform for citizen engagement and in the platform you don't provide an equal access or you limit the freedom of speech, so you censor some user and not make possible to them to interact in an equal manner with the other. Of course this is not in line with freedom of speech that is protected by the law and so there is an infringement of the law and the people can make illegal action against you for this kind of activity. So of course we focus on data protection but also other fundamental rights are protected by the law and we can react in case of illegitimate limitation of these rights. And create a large-scale system that interacts with the social dimension. Of course this risk is increased because many aspects of the life are potentially touched. And for this reason the intent of mitigation measure is important not to focus only on the technical side but considering first all the legal implications. And second if you look back to the Toronto case it's very important also to consider the non-legal dimension we can say. For instance in Toronto one day create a project, Google create a lot of interaction with the citizen in order to shape the project. There are five big books online about all these activities. Also Christian activities for citizen engagement myself. But after one year the project was rejected by the citizen. And the main reason was that they always discuss about how to do the things but they never discuss about the fact that that project should be implemented and that kind of activity should be realized. So they never discuss we can say the level of impact of the project on the citizen life. And this is the typical approach so the lack of effective participation and the lack of understanding the non-legal social ethical dimension of the project. In the use of technology, when use technology in society you have to focus not only on what is technical and feasible, not only on what is legal possible but also what is social acceptable. That's the thir

d element that is very important because you can have the technology. You can have something that is legally okay but if the people don't want that there is no way. Of course you can try to pursue it, you can use marketing whatever you want. But the social acceptability is one of the three requirements for them and the project for the social approach. You can have the best technology, you can have all the legal compliance but if the people don't trust in the system, don't trust in the solution, the solution doesn't fit for the social view of that community, never work. So for this reason in all this project is important not only to have legal staff but also have expert in social science that are able to understand the context and to shape the project according to the context. And for this reason there are teams of social expert and there are a lot of activity in terms of participation in order to understand why the people want something, how the people want something. If you look to the project of Smart City that have reached the best result usually staff from this kind of approach focusing on the needs of the citizens, discussing with them and design system that fit with this kind of needs. If it's a top down exercise that you ask to a big company and this is something that happened that they provided the model for Smart Cities for you and copy and paste it and adopt top down in your cities, if you see it's difficult that it works because it's not something that is accepted by the people. So this is not about only the legal aspect but as a computer scientist you should be aware that the sizes of IT project is a combination of different factors. Legal compliance of course is a condition, if there is no legal compliance there is no room for the project but if you have legal compliance and good technology and you have not an effective social acceptability of the project the project will not run. And this means that we have to invest also in this kind of activity. Last point is the liability of course if the project have designed without taking into account all these aspects the risk is that there are legal action and rejection. And of course those that provide technology, municipality etc. are very sensitive. Because the major is concerned about the next election. I wonder Smart City that is nice, people are happy and voting for our airport the next election. And if the system doesn't fit with the social needs it's difficult that the major is happy about the result. And worse if the system is considered as a stupid brother and the limited citizen rights etc. this is a backslash for our reputation and so it's not good. So computer scientist should also have this broader view, it's not on a matter of hardware and software, it's a much more complicated system including many political evaluation also of the society. That was a strategy important to our connection with the people involved etc. 5-7 so we can stop.
