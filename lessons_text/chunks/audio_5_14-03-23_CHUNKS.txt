 I will record the lecture that you can see online. So if you have to go at 7, you can see online the class. I'm showing you, but it's not. I don't know. I don't know. Stay until 8, not until 7, 30. Go ahead and say it. 7, 40 something. Just to give you an idea. So it's not until 8, but it's up. So it's not until 7. So that's for artistic reasons. I'll leave it as it is. I'll leave it as it is. I'm going to write this lecture. Oh, no. So we'll go to the lecture. I don't know what's the problem. Yes, then I'll write a lot of books. So artistic reasons are really sorry, but... I don't know if it's a book. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to write. I'm sorry. So I have to start with a question. I think we do with a question that we didn't have the time to do last guest day, last lecture, last class. No. I don't have any connection here. We are really unlucky. I could say I cannot show you. But anyway, I can ask for a comment. Even if we don't have this presentation. And what do you want to do? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ask me yesterday. It was not really connected to be sure on the previous issue. But I think that as our course is data protection and ethics, I think that it's important to say something more about what happened now in the United States. I think that all of you read about the SBB prizes. Something that is in a certain sense with my point of view, as I had a professional experience in that kind of field, is something that made me so surprised because I saw that in the last 20, 15 years of what happened, every part of the world that now we are, all of us, the most cool start-upper of the world. I think that, yes, something has changed. And I hope that most of you will open a new company and will start to make a start-up. But at the same time, we need to be really concrete. We have to know that it's just not the idea that is important. But it's also the execution. It's a very important thing. It's important to understand what is happening. No, it's not. It's like a tent. Ah, no, no. They have just a few seconds. You have to be careful. I'm sure. Sequoia is a wonderful rule for a pitch. I hope that you don't put this a pitch if not you can Google it. And then there are some rules for a pitch. And then what happened in the last 15 years that then you respect this Sequoia rule, and then you do this corner position, and then you learn how to come on into the first period of time, but then you lost all the money in about two, three, four years. And one company, two companies, three companies, one hundred companies, one hundred companies, all these incredible failures of a lot of start-ups, that is not an issue because failure is something that is good. You have to see a failure as a good thing because if you fail, you can know what are the things that you don't have to do. But this kind of failure has a cause. So, you know, this most has been basically supported by SBB. Now, the question, the specific question is because I said about the last lecture, and you explained about the fact that there is a liability in a certain sense of the state. And now, and he may use other cases to explain this potential and final liability in the state. Now, how is the situation in the SBB case? The situation is the same because in a certain sense what happened is that basically all the person that had a bank account and what they found could have the possibility to withdraw money, but just for not all the amount of money. So, what is sure is that the bank has to guarantee something that is the minimal amount of money, and this is guarantee because it's different in this case, this failure rather than the failure that we had in 2008 with the Lennon brothers. Because in this case, we have the opportunity, in that case there were futures, and then there was no possibility to have an insurance that gave this kind of money. In this case, the Federal Bank, the Federal Bank in the United States, would cover just a part of the money. So, the money that you ask now, but all the investments that are made by all these found probably will not be guarantee. I don't know the answer because they are going to decide now. So, one day they say that they will find a solution for all these found that they probably lost a lot of money, but they will lose, they will say, they will say lost. But in my view, it's probable that the state will not guarantee that kind of money. Why is this kind of distinction? Because at the very end, all these found decided to invest on a really risky activity, this basically start up. So, that's why at that point, there was a big mistake made by the SPB with the long-term investment. This is another story. This was a mistake of the bank. At the same time, I don't think that for this kind of mistake, the state will cover this kind of amount of money. Also, because then I finish with an ethical point that's really important, because this kind of guys basically are a person that earns a lot of money in the last 20 years with all the SSEI, KOMBALE, BOOM that we have with initially with Google and Facebook, all these investors and a lot of money with this kind of investment. Whether it's the IT or the BNB, whatever, all the big start up that now are incredible companies. So, in my view, perhaps it's just that if it's my mistake, it's just a personal opinion, it's not correct to give this kind of insurance from the state that basically is because of the person that when this situation was good, they had a lot of earn. Now that this situation is bad, it's true that there is a mistake of the bank, it's true that this situation has changed, but it's also true that if I want to save my money, I don't invest on start up, I don't put my money

 there, I put my money in another situation. So, it's something that we will see in the next future, but at the very end I don't see a real similarity between the example that Alessandro Mancadero made to you in the last lecture with this case. It's interesting, there are points of view on the dates. It's another case where the Federal Bank has to cover just the deposit, not the investment. Understand what I mean? Sorry for my answer, perhaps it's not what you want to hear, but it's my point of view. So, if you don't have other questions, we can continue with our con. Today we discussed a little bit about accountability. As I told you yesterday, accountability is something that it's the way to solve your problem also when you are the examiner. It's the basic and the fundamental principle in the GPR. Now, it's important, this is the definition that we learned by heart, that the controller should be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with their both principles. Why it's important? The fact that the controller should be able to demonstrate compliance because GPR and data always, always change. Every single day you have a new app that creates a new activity with data. If you remember yesterday, I told you about synthetic data and now there is an app that Google will use, I'm going to use synthetic data. So, it's something that changes in a certain point of view the way for Google in the next future, use data just to give you an example. So, it's not like the crime of that. It's not like you can change the way you make it that, but this kind of element that's always the same. In the scenario of data, we cannot learn, especially with artificial intelligence, we cannot provide in a correct way what will happen in the next future with our data. How artificial intelligence will manage our data. That's why this law, the GPR is founded on this principle that this accountability means. I don't know, you can also decide, this is important for you, you can also decide not to inspect the law. I tell you that you should be, you need to have the consent. You can also do a processing without the consent of the people, but you should be able to demonstrate why you think that this is compliant with privacy. So, this is the tricky issue of accountability. Accountability is to what I said, the most important European authority explains this, the data collection authority obviously explains this in this way. I say, don't worry, you can also violate the law, but you should be able to demonstrate why you did this kind of violation and why you think that this is compliant. Why I want to explain this because, as I explained before, privacy always change. We cannot, something that now it seems absolutely illegal, could be legal, fanatical and say compliance perspective in the next future. Because the data and the processing of data is something that is not predictable as other, that's why accountability principle is fundamental. Obviously, accountability principle is fundamental for other also law, but specifically the GDPR is really the most important principle that we have. So, I told you that the data processing and the connection between data protection and accountability, and we have to go, we read the definition of personal data, now we will see the definition of data processing. Data processing means any operation or set of operation which is performed or personal data or on set of personal data were not by automated beings such as, now we will see a long list of a kind of activity that could enter in the definition of data processing. So, it's not just the idea that we have is that the data processing happen only when you treat, when you have an active role with the data, but also when you just store, when you just read the data, is it a treatment? The consultation, the retrieval, the dissemination, obviously this is more clear, so we have a lot of these, but you don't have to remember all the kind of processing, just you have to remember that data processing means that you have a lot of processing. Data processing then regarding a purely personal or household activity carried out by private individuals does not fall under the GDPR. Now we have some case study that is really simple to understand, but it's something that I showed you since the beginning. Don't make the mistake that a lot of time happened. The GDPR, who is the subject of the GDPR, the physical or the legal entity? Physical person or legal entity? Who is protected? Physical person. And the person that should respect GDPR is a legal entity. But it could happen that physical person, physical person, and what could be charged for a violation under GDPR. I mentioned this and then I decided to add, so you will see this example in the new slide that I will upload today, because I think that it's important for you to understand a little bit about the outside world of the country. Also because at the end of the class some of you asked me about that, and then I am just looking at for you as you manage data, probably manage data in the next month. It's important to understand that we are not in a situation where you can do whatever you want, just because you are a physical person. That's the important principle and that's why I decided to make these two cases. What happened in this really leading case, that is the body linked case, that means that the Mrs. Lee-Krist, who worked as a catechist in Sweden, she followed the course on which she had to set up an input web page, so she created this page, and then the idea was to give an help, useful information to the church and church floors. But this web page included personal information about the catechist, who were not aware of it. An

d then what kind of personal data or special categories of data? No, I don't have a voice. Special categories of data, in the first place. So I am in the case in which I am a person who is a little more trained, because I have to use my own language. I have a beat, but... So she was criminal accused for a legal perspective. Because in the... Some countries in Europe, you can be also criminally black for data protection and violation. She claims that the household exception was adopted. So this is a really old case. Just because it was in 2001, but now the old mention in this case is a legal case. The Court of Justice excluded the exception, stating that it's related only to activities carried out in the course of private and family life, and never through publication of data on the internet, so there are many accesses accessible to any different kind, and different number of people. So what is the principle here? Is that if you... Coming back to the other example, if you are with a friend and you post this photo on Facebook, and this photo could create a problem to this person because he said to this girlfriend that he was in another place and the girlfriend started to be upset or vice versa, and then the boyfriend started to be upset because there was a... So this classical example, this is a situation where you can apply the household exception, because it's something that the regarding your private life, so it could happen this, you can make this kind of mistake in privacy, and you will not be legally processed for this kind of activity. But when you make some activities that are connected with not your life, but with something that is... Because the church activity is not professional activity, there is a certain sense to be professional activity, but it's not a private life. I cannot tell you if I agree or disagree with this kind of decision, but anyway this is the principle that we have to understand. So the principle is, please guys, it's not something that you can say, okay, as I am a physical person, I can do whatever you want. I can, for example, make a cyber attack to the Polytechnic of Turin because I am a physical person, so I will not violate that protection. Could be the last thing for me to say, obviously when you make a cyber attack, you have other crimes, like the legal access to an IT system, for example, or the damage of an IT system or others, so you have other crimes. It would be good for me to understand if your activity here as a student could be seen as private or professional, but in a certain sense for me you should enter into the modeling with this principle. So household activity, but just for something that is related to your family, to your friend, in this sense you have this exception. So the principle is that of referring on an internet page to various various persons and identify them by name or by other means, for instance by giving their telephone number or information regarding their work, condition and office, constitute the processing of personal data, rule your partly by automatic means, giving the meaning of article 3. This is the first law in the starting point that you remember. This obviously of the directive 1995-1996 that was the president directive. Now we have obviously the GDPR, the general rule of the European Regulation 679 of 2016. Then we have another case that is more recent and was another not really simple to pronunciate. This name but this Bui, Buiwitz, I hope that this is the right pronunciation, the case. Mr. Buiwitz take off police officer at the police station and upload the video on the YouTube. The Latvian VPA, the protection authority, ordered to remove the video because he had infringed data protection law. He appealed these guys up to the Latvian Supreme Court which referred the following court question to the European Court of Justice. Does the data protection law apply in this case? Was it household activity or not? So this kind of household activity you remember you also mentioned when you tame someone in the, for your personal interest, protect your family, in this case was not the same because Mr. Buiwitz's activity was not household activity because the video was uploaded on the internet. So these are the cases I manage the case. That was against YouTube and we have the same problem. When you upload, when you do the activity of dissemination, the definition of data processing, you risk a lot about your household activity. At the same time I have a lot of other cases that are different because when you publish for example on Instagram or in talk and you know about them, I'm sure for Instagram, we have cases only for Instagram, and you have a photo of your friend and this publication, you are in a household exemption. So we have these two cases that means that you never know what will be the application of the GDPR. It's important to understand again I don't want to create confusion but I see that for you it's clear that the GDPR applies to the physical person and the person that should respect the GDPR are limited. This is a risk so we don't have to make confusion. But this household activity, if you want to continue your answer, it's important because there is some distinction. So when your activity is not limited to your family and friends and private life activity, but you start doing an activity that could be more than what I say, there could be a problem for data protection. Another case that I manage now and again it's called YouTube. The other one was in 2010, quite complex. Now it's a little bit simpler because what happened that an intelligent guy, a YouTuber decided to put a GPS on his bike, not the one that was already present in the summer bike, it was a

 personal creation of a GPS. So he lived the bike without any chain free in the city of Milan and then he started to see who took this bike. Of course you have seen this video and you have followed this project. What is the problem? The problem is that at the very end he tried to do this video, upload it on YouTube, but he made a mistake with the person. So he thought that the person was one guy but he was not. This guy was completely innocent and obviously the guy started to be a little bit upset because he said, you have made me for a stupid reason just for your view and that I have a reputation that has been compromised for your video. So what why we are discussing about house of extension and the data protection violation? Because I know the future because the data protection violation is not only liable for data protection violation, the catch that appeared in this video, but also you and why do you think that it's possible that this guy, Gabriel Magnastre, he had the same problem as the first person in the video. What is the reason why you think that he is liable? Yes, is it similar to the case that we discussed a couple of questions about the volume and the fact that the website was considered possible for the content of what you uploaded on it? Yes, but what is the issue? Yes, there is in general terms, it's not privacy, it's a Congress directive, so it's something that you have to learn about. It's important that you know. There is no responsibility for the platform because the only responsibility is to take down the content if you receive a valid notice. If you send a notice to the provider and this provider is a valid, it's a legal notice. I cannot say you have to down this video because it's from another supporter, a football team. So this is not a valid reason if you have a legal reason and then open the discussion. The only role is to take down the video. And the video was to keep down, to spin the video. What is the activity that could create a liability more than the... I have no idea. It's a simple answer. Because it's always the same answer. The money was basically YouTube taking money from the visualization from the view. Obviously, most of the YouTubers will earn money from the view, but as you know, most of the money is at the end of YouTube. So if you monetize that video, because you earn money, and so you participate in the crime, because in a certain sense you accept the risk that something illegal could be uploaded on the platform. This is the big, big point of view that we are discussing when we talk about the platform. It's not to say the platform is not liable. This is the general principle. Because obviously the platform has no any interest to create damage to this poor guy that was identified as a theft that puts him in a situation where he didn't want to. There is no real advantage. Google could earn money from a lot of other videos, not only from that video, but Google accept the risk that some illegal videos are uploaded and earn money. It's not free service. At the very beginning, YouTube, and also Google Video that puts the other services, doesn't have any advertisement on the platform. But now, as you know very well, you have a lot of advertising. So a lot of money for the platform. So the platform, in the view of your security, is not to say that it's true that at the very end, the security will win the case. But in the end, the security said, you earn money from this video, you will pay as the creator of the video. So you both go to the trial. Okay? So just to make an example, just to help you understand a little bit how it's going to be. Because at a certain point, probably the YouTuber will try to ask the household exception. But I don't think that we will have a possibility to ask the household exception. Why for you? Why is it applicable for a YouTuber the household exception? Because it's a professional, it's a professional activity. A YouTuber, it's a professional in certain circumstances. It's an economic, you earn money when you do business. So that's why both as a family of family extension, why is it not possible to ask the household exception? Just to help you understand a little bit how it works. Nobody of you does know how if you need to enter into the Google YouTube program, nobody of you are interested to know how it works, just to give you an idea of how this comes to become a YouTuber now. Because you need to have more than 10,000 views in a certain period of time for a certain type of video. So it's not so simple to become a YouTuber, to monetize a video. So you say, okay, I mean, because there is a lot of video that I view more than 10,000 persons, but if you upload a video, it's difficult to reach 10,000 persons view. It's not impossible, it's not impossible, but it's a professional activity. That's why if you are a YouTuber or a TikToker or whatever, I don't know the number of TikTokers, how can you become a TikToker, but I can tell you for sure for YouTube, it's a professional activity. So you cannot say, oh, I'm a physical person. I use this video for my private life or whatever. It's a professional activity. Yes. And again, for the first point, even if you don't earn money, it depends on what kind of video you upload. Because if you upload a video of your friends, it's not a big issue. But if you upload a video of a person that enters a church, for example, it could be tricky. So you have to take care of what kind of video you upload. Because anytime that you make a photo, there is an history behind that. I will tell you if you don't know, John, tell me if you haven't seen it. Another case that I mentioned was, I thought that only the Italian guys would appreciate this case,

 was made in Naples, and it was at the beginning of Street View case, the Street View activity. And at the beginning, again, when an engineer doesn't ask for a lawyer, the idea was not to blur the image of the person. So it was not... they didn't think, basically, they didn't think, because they said, OK, it's a collateral damage. There is some person in the street, I will make a photo of this person. It's a public street. So what could happen? And it happens that a Napoleon guy was in a balcony and he was smoking a cigarette, and then his wife started a divorce with him on the fact that he recognized the photo of an husband smoking a cigarette. And the legal assumption is that if he smoked a cigarette, he had sex before. This was the assumption. The Italian assumption is, obviously, it's mathematical. If you smoked a cigarette, you had sex before. So this was a bit interesting. I appreciate this. For me, it's a conclusion that I never thought that was so automatic, that when you smoked a cigarette, you had to put every part of the seat where you see someone that smoked a cigarette, you think, you had to take the finals before he had sex. So, anyway, this was the difference. Anyway, what was the problem? The problem is that we, who got in the photo of a person in the house of obviously another woman, the one who was the person who potentially had sex. And this is why it's something that's really crazy when you start to make a photo because you don't know what is behind it or any single image that you upload on the body. If you keep in your normalities of the problem, if you start to put online a photo, you have to see what is the context, every situation. Yes. Yeah, and we will see also about this. There is, when we talk about, we will cover this case. And this is a problem of legitimate interest. So, I will anticipate the answer, but don't worry because this is an important point that we will discuss after perhaps also today. Legitimate interest means when you have a public webcam, you have a certain sense of the interest to add this kind of information. For example, I imagine when there are some webcams that show you, for example, the weather, so you want to know what is the weather in Turin and then I have this kind of webcam. Obviously, it depends also on what is the kind of footage that they have. But anyway, the point is, there is legitimate interest and then there is the potential violation of privacy. Because at the same time, this kind of webcam could record something that could cause damage for the privacy of the person. What is important is that you make a balance, sorry, again, the first lecture, the first class, the balance between the interest of the citizen and the potential violation of privacy. And you have to make this kind of distinction and with the school legitimate interest assessment. And if you produce a document that demonstrates that the legitimate interest of the data controller, so the person that has this kind of webcam, is more important than the potential damage, the data protection violation for the data subject, you are authorized to use this webcam. So again, it is evaluation, it is a risk assessment that you have to do. And what are the measures that you have to use? Obviously, the kind of, I don't know, type of work that I do. For example, it is a webcam that is like handed the webcam that we have here, we pull the physical person, it is not the legitimate interest, it is in the favor of the physical person. So you cannot have this kind of webcam. If you have a webcam in a place where you don't have so many people that pass, for example, the legitimate interest is in the favor of the person. So it depends case by case, you have to evaluate, but the rule is the legitimate interest. We will go on more detail in the next slide. Sorry, I have to throw mine. Okay, so, 4p loss of GDPR. To tell you the truth, these are not so fundamental for the exam. Why? Because I want that to go out from this course, not as an expert of data detection. The fact that you come and say to the person that is able to make a professional activity of data protection. I want that you finish this course and you will have the basic principle of data protection. The balance of interest, accountability, these are the kind of questions that is important for me. But it is also important to go a little bit on detail, so perhaps some of you are interested about this slide, other less, but why is this 4p loss? It is important to understand what are the most important, the four activities that any legal entity should do to be compliant on GDPR. So, if you have a potential area of startup, if you want to be positive, it is really important to slide that down. What is the answer? Just to be clear, what is the most important and what is the most important thing? So, for PILAS, records of processing activity, data processor, data protection and assessment, data rich. What is the records of processing activity? It is a sheet in an Excel file, basically. You can also have a tool, you can also have a lot of other instruments, and it is a vision as an Excel file that presents any single data processing that a legal entity do, any single. So, we can read the definition, each controller and we are applicable to the controllers representative shall maintain a record of processing activity under its responsibility. What are the columns of this sheet? We have, obviously, the kind of activity that you do. Figure out what we discuss about the YouTube video. So, I am a YouTuber, I want to be compliant with the data protection law, and then I start to form these Excel files. And then the first goal is, okay, what is the processing activity? I will make vi

deo, and so I create video, and then I process this video. So, you have to be quite precise because one thing is to create a video. So, go on streets and then create a video. One thing is to process the video, two different activities. And then what kind of potential data are you possess? So, probably physical person and also what are the characteristics of this kind of data? Are special categories of data or common data, just personal data? And then you have to provide, yes, normally I would process personal data, but I cannot exclude that to also process special categories of data. And then other column is what kind of security measure you use to protect this data? And then if I'm a YouTuber, I would say, okay, I will have my Mac, my Mac is quite safe, not so much, and then I have to implement my saver, I have a backup, I have some antivirus and whatever. Obviously, it depends on what kind of activity we are discussing. We are discussing about a simple activity, and then we are discussing about a YouTuber. If you talk about Stellantis, for example, that we are monitoring, obviously they have a little bit more safety measure, almost for the technique of terrain. But just to give you an idea that you have for a single processing activity, single processing of data, you need to find the field is formed in an Excel file or whatever, because you can also use, it's not important the type of tool that you use, the important is the information that you explain in this processing activity. Then you have another important principle that is data processor. Data processor means that what processing is to be carried out on behalf of controller, the controller should use only processor, provide sufficient guarantees to implement technical organizational vision. This is the most important principle and it's pretty clear, because in the legal culture, the problem is only to identify the final responsible. But from a technical perspective, from an engineer perspective, you cannot protect data if you don't protect the chain, the supply chain of the person that processed this data. What it means, it means that if I am a YouTuber, I have a lot of data processor, because I don't keep my data in probably, in hardware, in my house, but probably I will use a data storage online, so a cloud provider. I could say Amazon, AWS, or I could say, or the HACCA, or whatever, there are a lot of cloud provider Google, I could put all my information in Google. And then it's important that when you choose a cloud provider, the cloud provider should be adequate, and the cloud provider should have a good standard of safety. Normally, when you go online and you choose a provider to store your data, just to be clear, less you spend, less security you have, less managing of data, you do that, because you don't spend so much, so you have to spend a little bit more if you want a good level of security. So more security is on the hand of the data processor, less liability you have as a data controller. The principle of the Google GPR is not that, okay, I don't have this data, the data is managed by Amazon, the data is managed by Microsoft 365, no, no, no. The problem is your problem, if you choose a good provider and you demonstrate that you do your best to choose your provider, you will not be liable. If you choose the less expensive provider because you don't want to spend so much, because this is the point, basically, 99% of the time is a question of money, you will be liable because your choice was not a good choice. So that's why it's important that the data processor agreement, the DPA, that should not be confused by data protection authority, because the data processing agreement is an agreement that you made between you and the cloud provider. And you could ask me, how can I manage to have an agreement with Google? Yeah, you don't have the opportunity to call a certain agreement and say, okay, we have to make an agreement. No, there is online a standard that you can use when you decide to have a Google product. And if you use the Google free product, you have a completely different treatment with respect to the situation where you pay the Google product, and this is the same for all the providers. So the choice of providers is on the basis of GDPR. The data processors, in a certain sense, are more important than the data controller. The data processors, so, and this is, all the other stuff, I will not ask in December, this is important, the data processor is the person that acts on the alpha of the data controller. So we will have another slide to explain this, but I used this slide to anticipate this point. It's simple, it's not difficult. There is the data controller that is the YouTuber, also because we use the example of the YouTuber, and then the data controller asks the two YouTubers to process this data. So YouTube acts as a processor on the alpha of data controller. This is the definition, simple but important. Then you have the data protection input assessment. What is the data protection input assessment? Anytime you start to do a risky activity in terms of GDPR, you have to do this kind of assessment. So it's a specific activity that all the data controllers should have. For example, when we talk about, before we were talking about welcome, and then I decided to put welcome in the whole city of Turin, it's a really, really risky activity. So I had to do legitimate interest assessment, and on the top, the data protection input assessment. The data protection input assessment is a rule, it's really concentrated on the safety and security measure and organizational measure. Because at the very end, what is important for the data protection authority is that you

protect also on the cybersecurity perspective this data. And then we have this four pillar, the last, and we will also discuss about this with a specific case that is the data breach. What is the difference between data breach and... This is a difficult question, perhaps some of you can also ask right now. What is the difference between an IT incident and an IT incident and a data breach? What is the difference? Data breach is done on purpose. An IT accident might happen even if... Yeah, it's a good definition. It's not true, but it's an idea, because it's true that data breach could happen also in most of the cases. In our idea is one that there is a willingness to commit this kind of activity. There is a will, exactly. But the difference is that it's a data breach when I involve the personal data. It's an IT incident where there are no IT data. This morning I think I stated this quite an important company in Italy and a very serious IT incident. Because the person made a mistake, an IT mistake, and some attackers took really important plans of being a boat. And then they took this information from Finkan here. But when I have a plan of a boat, of an airplane, or whatever, there is not any personal data inside. It's just technical information regarding the way to build a boat. But it's not personal data. So we are not in the data breach. When perhaps I made a mistake like I send you an email and I want to send an email to... Sorry. And then I put in copy all of you. And everybody... I don't know if you know... I think that I hope that they will learn the degree of privacy policy. But anyway, it's just a mistake and then I put in copy everybody of you. So each one of you start to know the name of the other. This does not make sense if the email is political. Obviously, but just if you use your personal email. Because it makes sense in this way. And this is a data breach. So it's a simple mistake. So I didn't put in CCN all the person. I put only CC person. So everybody of you knows the other email addresses. And then this data breach, why? Because there are personal data. So this is the email address in this kind of situation. Okay. Anyway, we will go back to the concept of data breach. In the case of personal data breach, the controller shell without a delay and were feasible later than 70 hours after having become a verification to notify the personal data breach, the supervisor authority. Why is the first bill the four bill? Because the data breach is something that makes it crazy. Normally, it is a controller because you don't have three days. It's really a little amount of time to start this kind of proceeding. And so if you want to be prepared, you have to study and implement a procedure that explains very well what kind of activity should do any person that is involved in this kind of process. So it's just a question of prevention that is really important. So four pillars that are caused by processing activity, data processor, data reflection input assessment, data breach, these four pillars are not important for the exam, but they are important if you want to start any kind of activity regarding data. So you need to have these four documents. The first is a file Excel. The second is a lot of agreement for all the data processor. It's important that you remember what is the definition of data processor. Then if you do, and I suppose that if you want to be compliant with privacy, you do an activity that is potential risky for a privacy perspective. You need to do the data protection input assessment, and then you need to have a procedure to be prepared if you have, if you receive a data breach, if you commit a data breach. Okay. Then I mentioned the point of loveliness. Again, another slide that is really a wall of text. Don't worry about that. It's important this just for the screen support. If you are interested, you can go. If you have a question, you can go. In that of all the legal basis. But this slide means that there are some personal data processing activity that should be in the lawful. So in this case is the data processing activity, the loveliness that you need to do for the personal data. But when you, if you remember I mentioned the traditional data, you need to respect this kind of rule. And when you process special categories of data, you have to respect this rule. What is the point? Is that if you see when I process a name, I should process this activity with the concept of the individual. Also in the case of special categories of data. So if I want to process an app data of you, I can ask you and I say, can I process an app data? You say no, I cannot process. You say yes, I can process. But when we talk about judicial data, there is no written consent. So I cannot ask, please, can you send me your criminal records? I cannot make this kind of question because there is no consent as a legal basis to process this data. Then obviously it's not only the consent, the only way to process data, because figure out that you have to go to the hospital and then you should be helped by a doctor. It could happen that the doctor doesn't have the time, but it's also crazy that the doctor should start a surgery to save your life. And then he asks, oh please, tell me the consent because I have to process your health data. It's logical that I have to process health data if I have to save the life of a person and if I am a doctor. So you have a lot of other situations. For example, processing is necessary to protect the vital interest of the data subject. But also there is another way, another vital interest basically. And then you have also the obviously social security and social protection law. For example, the law enforcement t

hat starts to import. When I have to start a research, an academic research, it is necessary this kind of activity for reason of substantial public interest. So if I have to process health data for medical research, I don't have to ask the consent of the person, but it's important that this is a substantial public interest. So what I have to, what is important in this slide is not to learn by heart all the legal activity, but just to know that any legal activity in the data protection scenario would remain sometimes with the consent obviously, but not only. Because we will see in a minute that there is also the possibility to have a contractual obligation. In the pizza case that we will see now, you will see that it's something that would start with the contract. I need that, you have signed a contract when you enter in the polytechnic. And the polytechnic would use your data to process without your consent some data for the purpose of the contract that is the opportunity to give you this kind of class. And so you have made a contract. So the only, when the question is, you need to ask the consent to process data, not only the consent, the consent would be substituted by other legal reasons. And for the judiciary, for the judiciary activity, the consent is not valid in the GDPR. So I cannot ask you to give me criminal records, should be provided by specific law. Okay, shall be carried out only on the court of official authority, or obviously the official authority can make this kind of activity, when the process is authorized by union or members state law providing for the appropriate safety and for the rights and freedom of data subject. It means that you need a law that outrides you to process this data. So I cannot ask you the data. But if you're discussing about special categories of data or personal data, you can use the consent, but you can use all these legal basis, all these list of legal basis. This one is consent, contract, legal obligation, again protect the vital interest, carry out the task in the public interest, and then this is the legitimate interest that you mentioned before I'm going to come back because it's really important that you remember the legitimate interest. And here you have other kind of kind of legal basis. We will not again ask you the list. It's important to understand that the consent is not the only way to process it. Then legal grounds. It's important because now the future, when we talk, everybody of us talk about the data monetization. I think that you know this data monetization. And the data monetization is a big, big decision that we have to make for the next future. To understand when there is a discussion about data monetization, the last class I also explained to you that data monetization means that you can exchange my personal data for certain services. I exchanged my personal data for money, for compensation. This is the basic monetization of data. You need to know these Article 7 of Registration. Because it's important to understand what are the conditions for the consent. The controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to the processing of this or her personal data. Written declaration. The request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other methods in an intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain languages. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject is non-genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without the treatment. This is a fundamental principle. Because the data subject is not genuine or free choice. Free choice, remember this word? Because this kind of word is the difference between make money and not make money when you work with Kata. Or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without the treatment. Consent should not provide a valid legal guarantee for the processing of personal data. In specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller. So there is a huge, so I say, ok, you cannot tell me if you are giving the consent. Or if you are right not to give me the consent. But if you don't do that, I will put a really bad regulation for your exam. This is obviously an example of an imbalance position of a professor against students. So I cannot use my power, as a certain says, to oblige you to give me the consent. Then right to withdraw the given consent at any time, but the withdrawal of consent should not affect the lofulness of processing based on consent before it is withdrawn. So there is a right to withdraw the given consent at any time. But the withdrawal should not affect the lofulness of processing based on consent before it is withdrawn. And then we go to the case. This is an Italian newspaper. You can have the same in New York Times. This is the cookie wall case. What happened in Italy, but in every part of the world, that now there is a serious problem for the editor because the newspaper is made by journalists and the journalists should be paid. Now, it's the first time that you go to take a physical newspaper. Where is the first time? One years ago, two years ago? No, never. So I imagine that you don't go and buy a physical newspaper in your normal life. Perhaps some of you buy, but basically we all use social media or online. And normally we don't pay for this kind of service. So the problem for the newspaper is that the only way to take money is to have advertising on the newspaper. Sometimes you have a lot of advertising, but it's the only way now for them to receive money. Not the only way because there are some who are always bought by this kind of stuff in the physical newspap

er. But it's just an example, a limited person. So the point is when you receive this question like this, where they say what is written on a written short translation, all the revenue that we receive from the ads help us to live basically in this newspaper. And for this reason we ask people to use cookies or similar technologies. I hope that you know what is a cookie. Yes, cookies, okay. For a different purpose as specifying a good policy. You are free to, and this is important, you are free to withdraw the consent, but in that case you have to buy the newspaper, you have to make a payment. So basically the question is if you accept this, you have cookies. If you refuse, you have to pay. What do you think? There is a, coming back to this slide, what is the problem on the cookie wall issue if you see the article 70? Free choice. It's not a free choice. So in a certain sense I completed the steps of the Republic of New York Times because they say it's my service, it's my news, it's my content. I would pay my journalist to produce this content. I just ask you to, you have two options. You give me your data or you pay this content. So this is the position of the newspaper. And for me it's a logical position. It's not a logical position. It's not like the position I and the professor have to give me the consent if you want the good evaluation. If not, this is really strong and bad and not guaranteed to pay us interest. In my view, in a certain sense, there is a, it makes sense. You cannot have everything for free. You had this kind of content for free because in the past you gave data. But now we have the GDPR and we have the cookie policy, the agent cookie policy because you cannot go online with your mobile and you can also click on the choice. And basically to give you some stats, it's 70, 60% of a person that made the acceptance of this kind of policy because it's not a big issue for you to be trapped online. And especially when you have to choose, you lose more time than you would when you accept. So the idea is I want to go immediately to the news, to the information, so I accept the cookie policy even if I don't read any things that is written on the policy but just for arriving immediately to the content. At the same time, any person that say I refuse this kind of policy create a big loss for this kind of content. So again, why I choose the example of republicans. Because this metrics under discussion of the data protection authority, the Italian data protection authority, the French data protection authority and it is also, you could say, in a sort of discussion also in the US but it's not as you know, there is no data protection authority in the US. So what is your point of view? Is right what republicans ask or not? My question is what do you think about? Is right republicans or not? Are you favour of the list? No, the list is not my name. It's just a position, it's just a thing. It's the future. I'm curious about your opinion because this opinion will change basically the way to process data. This is the big question. Because if you agree with republicans, you will accept the fact that you can monetize your data. You accept data and this is really important that you understand because on the basis of all this course, this data protection and data ethics is personal data are fundamental right or not. Because if personal data are fundamental right, if personal data are fundamental right, you don't have the power to decide if you can monetize your data. I try to be clear, it's really simple as it was. Personal, fundamental right is your left list. It's apparent that the author of the choice to also pay because you also have the choice to print out and not print out the list. Even like for free, you can in the library, you can use the question for example. It's a good position. I cannot tell you if it's a good position. I don't know if it's true or not, but it's a logical position what she said that it's fair, the fact that we have this position of republicans or for the newspaper. But again, I will try to explain why fundamental right changes. Because for example, my body, my heart is a fundamental right. So I cannot decide to sell a piece of my body for a personal point. It's a violation, not only for the criminal law, but it's also a violation of fundamental right. I say, okay, every good part. I will send you, if you have a problem, an art problem, I give you my heart and then you can pay the money. And I save my family. There are some persons that, I have known in my professional experience as a criminal lawyer that ask me, okay, please kill me, and with my body please pay all the debt of my family. There is a lot of persons that ask this, and this is a situation that could happen. I hope for you that will not happen, but could happen that you can try to monetize your body. And hit that please. There are a lot of examples around the world. I say, you know, because you know the real situation of the human being, and you don't have to do it for an example. You have to do it for an example. You have to do it for an example. Not your heart, but in the situation, for example, the slope, I think if you have to stand for enough, I think you have to, I think if you have this, I would have this. I think I can, I think it's important that you, I think it's important that you, I think it's important that you, you put a lot of content in on your answer but then again you you have a completely different you have a completely different and your name? Elena different opinion you say it's fair and you said no it's not fair and it's also a respectable opinion I don't have a gay asterisk I don't know what is the asterisk but you can see that th

ere is an incredible change because the example of the body is the strongest self but until business is spending also privacy was a fundamental right my data always was my data fundamental right so I cannot sell my data but for example things that Elena is right and then Elena sorry is right and then we will start to sell our data we can change the word in Guanyan that we are for sure that this will happen because if I can sell my data I am sure and this is a question for you perhaps I am wrong that you say ok I don't want to buy a bike I can sell my information for three months of all my interest all my interest for three months and then they give me 2000 euro and I buy the best bike that I love or the best bike or something like that because the bike is a little bit more expensive but anyway just to make a stupid example so how many of you will start to bargain the data for personal interest how is the value that you give to your data how is the value if you go to Human Data Income website that is a project that I managed was an experiment for me now it is closed in especially in India where we have now a strong legislation regarding data protection but a couple of years ago or not a couple of years ago we had not so strong legislation but then there is also a team that there is on the Indian perspective there is a lot of persons that they want to sell data to their money and they are absolutely keen to sell data but I am sure that also European persons are able to sell data and so if my assumption is true perhaps I am wrong perhaps all the population doesn't want to sell data but if this is true what happened to Google what happened to MENHA what happened to Instagram we have to close them because the company is not more interested on the activity of Google because Google basically lives because they know your interest but Google is not so precise like you so if Elena starts to sell is constantly interested it is perfect so I am a Mercedes or BMW or Audi and I will pay a lot of money to Elena to obtain this information so we will have a lot of intermediaries of data not that we imagine that I will pay direct Elena but I will use intermediary the Teven Agreement with Elena and Elena will have a sort of deposit and at the end of the day she can see how much money she has earned with her data and this is the data monetization and why I think that you are right because it is not a big issue this example but the start of this scenario the starting point of this scenario if the decision of the judge will be okay, the public at a mirror times it arrived so the next step would be okay, then we can it is not the fundamental right then we can use data of the specific then there is some company that starts to say okay, you want to earn 1,000 euros a month is tell me whatever what you want I will give you a few a lot of information and then I will pay 1,000 is a little bit more than what is expected just to give you an example I don't know how it will be the market but the market will absolutely change that's why we are at a crucial point of our life and I don't know if it's true because in a certain sense if we accept, if we write Elena we can solve the problem but if you ask about the fact that the platform developed a very large online platform could have a real problem so we can stop the fact that we will have as a Google, Metal, Amazon because you start to destroy this kind of incredible structure that now manage the web because basically as you know every platform has the ownership yes, the web is a free place where everybody can do whatever they want yes, but without Google, Metal and Instagram is another web so what we want is that we can start to change in a certain sense the world with a new idea what is, and this I am really fascinating about this kind of future and I think that it's a good evolution but at the same time I'm not sure and you said this and I agree with you what will be the future in a situation where you don't have a centralized world but you have a decentralized world and if you see all the crypto activity and then blockchain and then blockchain and crypto and we go, we are going to a decentralized world so we have all the tools and all the instruments for a decentralized world and I'm very fascinated about that but at the same time I think that the control of the information is good because if you don't have it even if I don't trust obviously the big platform but I think that at the very end if I make a state and I have to keep think that the state is a thing the state does not have a personal interest in the idea of a state, a democratic whatever state there is the interest to protect the citizen if I have just Google as a person in the web to discuss so I have not too many platforms I can, for example what happened now is that the problem was found for 390 million dollars from the data protection authority we will do that in this case because it's connected and then you can have this kind of control but in a decentralized world where everybody can do whatever you want everybody can sell and we will have a lot of intermediaries and we have a situation where you cannot control the system the system is controlled by us if you want to explore this concept we have a book with the author the author is Seroviyeky and the book is Collective Intelligence so we are ready to a collective intelligence we think that the work could be managed not by a little number of persons but all of us with all our choice this is the future that, again I'm really fascinated by this kind of work I'm a little bit worried but I feel that some services that should be centralized should be centralized you can start to say ok but we can manage by

 ourselves and so too much for today I understand but it's something that is a scenario that we have to discover coming back to more simple questions the point is, it's true that we can turn at the turning point for the monetization of data and comment ok, so we can make a summary of what I said in October 2020 several sites of the Imagery of the Italian Newspaper and Magazine those of the JD Group Republica, La Stampa, that is of Turin and several local days have introduced the message as an visitor who are not subscribers to subscribe or to accept to visit or are profiling in technology design to offer them more personalized and more than you access both the pages of the website the Italian Data Protection Authority is open and the investigation is the result of this kind of work no, this is not a very serious question this is a very difficult question I know that it's useful to know it's a mechanism that allows a user to access the website in only one way, by giving consent and all cookies walls are prohibited the European Data Protection Board said in order for consent to be free be given access to services and functionality must not be made conditional on the consent of the user to the story of information, or gaining of access to information already stored which is a determinant equivalent of the user a paywall is a mechanism whereby the user is given an alternative to access content such as payment or subscription instead of giving consent to the user are paywalls legitimate? and this is the question and then it's a matter of consent is consent given as an alternative to the payment of some money really free the Austrian Data Protection Authority has already stated that the cookie paywall system is a valid solution if the subscription proposed by the scientists and modern costs, as not as to restrict the user's freedom the decision of the Data Protection Authority of paywall on the other hand is still avoided the decision in France and in Austria are basically decisions that give us the idea that we won't go in a certain direction at the same time we won't risk so much and that's why I think that it's important to see not only this decision that I don't know when we will have but also the decision of the European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor so it's important that the most important institutions that are composed by all the Data Protection Authority give a clear indication about this decision because again this decision could have an impact but the general idea about this kind of paywall is that it's not an invalid system so probably we will have this kind of regulation then we will have two more slides and then we have finished Article 8, General Data Protection Regulation child's consent, it's really simple we have a situation that is quite crazy because we have the opportunity to put the minor child in a different situation from 13 up to 16 so the GDPR said that any single member states can choose to determine who is the lowest age, it should be not below under 13 years old and then this is the decision that we have now so for example in Italy it's 14 years old how is that as an effect, real effect basically on the web services so you can have an account for the European law for example in Italy when you are 14 years old but to tell you the truth it's a crazy issue because Instagram is managed in the US and the age is 13 and so anybody of you I think perhaps start to use this kind of tool after 13 years old or not but anyway just to let you know that there is this law and the general age to have an access is 16 but there is the possibility between 13 and 16 then we can finish with this last information that I anticipate to you and the next class that we will have next Monday we will go on the example but again legitimate interest were sold by the controller or by a third party except we are such interested in Paragloma and then by the interest of fundamental right and freedom of the data subject which requires retention of personal data particularly when the data subject is a child legitimate interest is not applicable to processing Paragloma by public interest in the performance of the class so this is the principle it will be simple when we go to the example the case but the point is that we have to assess the legitimate interest of the controller and the impact of the data subject so I can start to have an activity that could be seen as marketing activity for example if the impact of the data subject is not so strong just to anticipate then we will compare this case I mentioned the pizza case in this case is Claudia from pizza by my love and a few days later the other students come on for cinema products so this is a case where the possibility the legitimate interest does not overrides the interest of the data subject because there is a connection between the fact that I have ordered a pizza and after two days I receive a discount to order other pizzas obviously it is a marketing activity but when I order a pizza and after two days I will receive information regarding sushi because there is a connection between the restaurant and the pizza restaurant and the sushi restaurant this is not the same so you have to assess every single time if it is more the interest of the data controller or and this interest would overrides the interest of the data subject the data subject we will go back on this kind of information but just to anticipate this two concepts and then put forth thoughts for the next lecture so some up and then we are finished so we talk about accountability we have to learn by heart these two ideas and we will try to be a perspective of bias with the principle then the definit

ion of data processing it is important not the least of the processing but the fact that data processing means a lot of activity you can put some example consultation and use then we go back to the household activity the case for the link is the one of the church and the one of the welcome for the police the takeover of the police and I explain the four pillars records data processing, data processing but assessment data rich also important but not for the example but to know what are the main activity then I explain this principle remember the fact that consensus is not the only legal basis to process data you have a lot of other legal basis especially in the judicial activity the legal basis is not the consent and then you have the condition for consent you don't have to learn all of this information the important point is the free choice this information really helps so we study but this is for the example free choice because it's the agenda with the cookie wall case that I present to you last week and then we will see the legitimate interest in the next lecture the answer for 8 means that the engagement is between 13 and 16 the generation of these in the states choose their advantage ok we are finished and we will see you next time
