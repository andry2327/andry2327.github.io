 I'm going to take a look at the French law enforcement ask to Google the information regarding the number of accounts. So we can see for example we can check where are from. You know, we can see how many requests are made by Iran. It's important that interesting information, really interesting information. And you can see not so many because as you know there is not a good cooperation between Google and Iran. So this is an interesting information. But if you go for example to Germany or Japan it's interesting. You can see how many information are requested by the law enforcement authority of Japan. Or for example if you want to see Italy, a real number of information. And then you can see the different kind of request because the blue one, I don't know why it changed because perhaps they didn't make a differentiation. That's why there was all the requests, the blue one. And then the red one is other request of legal type. And then there is the yellow one that is the request of information regarding the case of emergency. We call it emergency disclosure. And then there is the conservation request, or data retention request that happens when you say, when you ask to Google to freeze a certain account for a certain period of time. And then you ask with the regulatory procedure, what is a regulatory procedure? Is a procedure to ask from a jurisdiction to another jurisdiction the possibility to have the information. So if you want the information of an Italian citizen you ask to Google to freeze that account. Then you go to the US Department of Justice, DOJ, and then the Department of Justice authorizes Google to send this information of the Italian citizen. So this is the transparency report. This is really, really interesting. You can check it, but there is not only this kind of information. The information regarding the law enforcement and the legal purposes. But there is also the request of removal made by copyright violation. Removal made by government, request by government. So you can see here, in this case you can download the report. And then you can have this kind of information that is the enormous number that makes me crazy. But I know it may make you crazy, because this is all the URL requests from 2015. So from the Custafian application up to now. And this is the incredible number. We have more than 5 million requests of URL. And then we have 1 million, 4,400,000 requests of removal. And we can see also here that the percentage of requests are 50-50 basically. So you have from this period of time, and this is all the country. But this is really interesting because you see, for example, in Italy, you have 58% not removed and 41% removed. If you go again, you can go again. It's not mentioned in the IP URL. This is interesting. But in that we can see Germany, for example, and the percentage is completely different. So what does it mean? That there is a lot of activity, on reputation activity, made in Italy. That is not the same as we have, for example, in Germany, because we have a different percentage. So this is really, really important. This is a business. If you go to Google and say reputation, for example, manager, you would see immediately this kind of company, this Italian company, that makes this kind of work every single day to monitor the web, especially Google, and to work to remove content. And then you can see the result again here. The results are crazy for me because 1 million and 400,000 requests and 5 million URLs is not so important in the web, obviously. But it depends on what kind of URL you want to remove. So we can come back to the report and then I will show you how it works. I'm really sorry about the fact that I cannot change. I don't know where I can share. At the bottom, what I'm supposed to change the language. If you are interested to follow this, you can go on your laptop and then you can see from your laptop. So the first question is what is the country? So you can ask more certain countries, not all the countries, who would ask to make this request. And why they decide this? Because it's totally, totally... No, it's not

 arbitrary, because it's basically all the European countries, even if not part of the European Union, could be connected. If you see this, so basically all the European countries, it's a service that you can use only if you are European. Sorry for that, if you are not European, but basically because why? It's obvious because we have a decision of the European Court of Justice. So they don't want to give this access to a person that is not on that jurisdiction. Because anyway, there is a lot of legal activity that should be done totally free for the user. So they want to limit the amount of user. This is obvious, but I don't think about it before. For me it was around the world, but it's not true. Obviously, please. Cannot do. I don't see US. But because the European Court of Justice decision, the one that I mentioned before, is applicable only in Europe. And so, to tell you the truth, I was sure that they decided to extend around the world. So for me, it's news also for me, but it makes sense, in a certain sense, because from a legal standpoint, what they want is to limit the activity. You have to figure out that just to give you an example, any activity, any legal activity, it takes from 500 to 1000 euro, and you have to multiply 1.4 million requests for 500 euro. This is the cost of all these requests that are complete, because any request that is made by us is a complete request. The effect is that the lawyer and attorney works to analyze the legal possibility to remove this content. So basically, it's really, really cost effective. I think that we are talking about from 500 million up to 1 billion of legal fees, yes, for this kind of job that was made by the State. So now, the reason with you, it's really difficult that they can extend to all the world this kind of effort. But at a certain point, I think that it's really important to give this opportunity to all the citizens around the world that use Google services, because I think that it's important. So forgive me if you're not European, but it's useful to complete this exercise just for you, and perhaps in the future you can use it. Then you can put your name, your last name, your name. Then if you work for you, you can put a station that is called myself, or if perhaps it could be a client, so if you are an attorney, then you have to put the URL, there is a wizard to explain how can you identify correctly the URL. And then you have to put the reason of the removal, so you have to explain that in the balance of interest that we mentioned before, you want to remove that information, because first of all, you are not a public person, because this is really important for the Google perspective, is my suggestion, is because it created damage to you. For example, an image that someone posted on the social, standing from the section that is really difficult to have, because they don't make an index of the image posted by social, but anyway, it happens that there is an image that you put on social, and then there is a WordPress website to give this kind of photo, and then you can identify this photo on the web. And then what happens is that sometimes it happens that this kind of photo could become viral. There is plenty of cases in every part of the world where some photos start to become viral, even if they are not of a famous person. The famous person becomes famous because of that photo, but perhaps this ridiculous photo is something that is an image or a video that is absolutely private. So you can write here and immediately Google will remove this information. So you can write here immediately, no, one month, one month and a half, but for the Italian justice is immediately, so I said immediately one month and a half is a good period, and then you can also add the group, because perhaps it happens that this image or this content appears when you Google Giuseppe Vaciago. But it could also happen that you have to put Giuseppe Vaciago at tourney, and if it happens or Giuseppe at tourney, whatever, so there is different query that should be put inside to avoid the fact that you can search that image or tha

t content. So that's why it's important. Then you can put these two consent about the fact that these information are true, and then you put the date and the signature that is not the signature, you only put your name in the signature, and then you can send these requests and you receive a mail, and then you can track these requests. It's not so easy to track, but the fact that after one month they can answer you saying that, okay, I have removed this information or not, I decided that you, in the balance of interest, I either removed the information. And this is the important part of the story. Have you understood this part? Any question about that? Then there is another part of the story. That is the following one. This one. That is, I put just because we were talking about our former prime minister. It's important to see this, and you have to understand this. This is the set or the interesting part of the story. When you go at the end, you can see that there is written, again, I'm sorry for the Italian but I made a translation, there is written some results that could be removed on the context of the EU rule of digital protection. And then you can go here and you can obtain more information. This means that some of this information could be removed. If you go here, anybody of you knows Lumen Database? If you go here, the Lumen Database is a project made by three universities, like the Stanford, Verde, Clay and Arboda, if I remember well, by the way, three US universities that are potentially in a strong way financed by Google and other platforms, but specifically Google. So you can go here and you can write a CVO. Here. AI. No, I said my question. You will see here all the requests made by Sirio Berlusconi to remove. There are more than 10,000 requests. So, Sirio Berlusconi, as you remember, in the last five years, seven years, requested 10,000, 10,000, more than 10,000 requests of removal. Okay, you can see here, but it's probably more of 1,000 pages. But anyway, we can see here, this is not the... You can play a little bit, I don't know. It's your time to ask, but it's really interesting here to see that you can see any single... And this is the information that was Sirio Berlusconi interview and started to conduct the interview in 2014. So it was interviewed by a person that worked for him in a certain sense because it was probably important. And then you can click here to request the access. And then if you put your email, and I don't want to put my email, for other reasons that I can explain for the person that I'm curious, you can have the VLV that is present online because this link was removed, but it was removed by Google, but the web is present. So if you want to know that kind of article, and you know that kind of information, you can... and also the request made by the attorney, the request, you can see that video that now is impossible to know because it was completely missed by Google. So it's really difficult to find something that is not in a search engine. Probably you can find it on Bing, because Bing does a Patuno's Bing job. But anyway, what you can find there depends on what kind of use it is. Anyway, the point is there is a big, big use business on the reputation side. So it's something that you need to know how it works, the system. So basically you can freely request the removal of information of a European citizen, and then, and then that might be an answer in your request. Not for the US, the trick is not the data protection, but the trick is... and it's the good work of the trick, because this basically is the DMCA, you can see here, it is the digital mining copyright act that is a US law, that is not regarding that protection, but copyright. So the... the simply, the experiment is to you, he said something that he was not good for, and then he said, okay, I use the data, the digital mining copyright act, so the copyright excuse, we could call it, to remove this information. And this act is applicable also, and specifically in the US. So all the US market use the digital mining copyright act, all the European market use the digi

tal protection, and also if they want the digital mining copyright act, because it's also applicable for the Italian citizen, because it's a US company, so you see a lot of DMCA requests here, then if you go, you will see also this kind of request that is entitled, that it means probably their Google's system of criminal content is based, this is the legal complaint that was made by the lawyer to remove this kind of content. You can play, it's a research project, but it's something, the only way that we have now in the world to keep some historical information, because if you want to know if something is deleted, you can go to Lumen database, please. I completely agree with you. I think that if you decided to go on any legal field, and you want to be a politician, you should have said that you are a private life, especially with the technology, but here is not the... it's appear so you cannot make this kind of request, but the ordinary people, the person that basically don't want to be part of the... people's... they have absolutely... the real problem is that it will be from the... rich people basically are friends and public... and now they do also things of public interest, but they are public persons, and it could happen that they are rich, and it could happen that they can pay an attorney to do this kind of activity. And ordinary people, and this is the big issue that we have, has not the power to do this, so basically you will see more requests by the person that should not make this kind of request, only for the fact that they have the economic availability to do this kind of request, because the ordinary people that has this kind of problem basically doesn't have the money to call a lawyer and to do this kind of activity. That's why I think that this tool is fundamental, because it's not very free, so you can use this kind of tool in a free way, that's why it's important. But in a general terms, if you go around the world and not only Europe, the big issue regarding reputation, and the reputation is an opportunity that only the rich person could have and not the poor person, understand what I mean? This is not correct, maybe, because it's a fundamental right. So every person should have the same right, depending on the level of the rich. You need to have the same right. In this moment, you can protect your reputation, but this is the only instrument that is free, if you are the ordinary person. Okay, so it's clear. I will work Lumen database, transparency, transparency reports, and in Australia. I will not ask you this kind of question for the exam, in Australia. Yes, the European Court of Precision, yes, absolutely. Not that this is a kind of exercise, but please keep this link up, because life could be helpful for you, so I think that it's important for you. Okay, we can continue with the other slide. If you want to have any kind of question. Again, we were discussing about the fact that there is a huge difference between a rich and poor person. This is another wonderful example. Mosley vs. United Kingdom. Who knows Max Mosley? Nobody will know. There was a really, really important figure on the International Federation in Formula One. It was the president of the Formula One. Formula One, the Italian or something like that. And that was really, really, really rich. And what happened? That the British National Weekly newspaper, News of the World, published a front page article about Max Mosley, a long figure in the International Mobile Federation, and Formula One, reporting his alleged Nazi sexual activity, including intimate photographs taken from secondly recorded videos. Okay, big issue. So, what asked Mosley? He said, the Court recognized that the private life of celebrities can look at the commodity for a certain sex sector of the media. The publication of news about such person contributes to the variety of information available to the public, and although we don't have the land, the proposals of entertaining rather than education benefit from the protection of financial situations. However, such protection may seem to the requirement of the r

ight privacy, where the information status is a means of private and intimate nature. There is no public interest in the dissemination. Coming back to your question. I don't know if the president of the Formula One, that is for me, is a real public person, in my view, because everybody of you knows, I think, that Formula One, and then the president of Formula One has a sexual, Nazi interest. I don't want to go into that of this kind of interest, but anyway, it's really crazy interest for me. For me, it's an information that should be communicated to the public, in my view. But there is a balance of interest, so this was a European Court of Human Rights, so really important, the strong court that decided that privacy would win against public freedom of speech or public information. I don't know if you agree on this kind of principle, but basically it's a strong principle. And that's why I think that it's important to understand that privacy is in this period of time. It has a role that is, in my view, also more important with respect to what we thought ten years ago, twenty years ago, but also ten years ago, because Facebook was created in 2006. We had Facebook in 2008. When arrived Facebook in Iran, if you have Facebook now? What, when? Twenty years ago. Twenty years ago. Twenty years? Facebook now? Facebook. It's not like that, in my favor. If there were no more, it would be a problem to invent. In my view, it's ten years that we start to have this kind of real use of social, and this kind of use of social change, the way of information, basically, because the information was just on one direction. We had newspaper, we had TV, and so you have information, unilateral information. Now we have information that could arrive from every part of the world. And then we have the same time an independent authority in Europe, but also not in Europe, as I mentioned before, that has the possibility to influence. And this is the point that is very interesting. The piece of history, because I give you an example when I mentioned cinema and storytelling. Probably if you play with the Lumen database, you will find a lot of other information also around the world, probably of your politician, if you are not Italian, I mentioned cinema in school because it's our politician. Do you have the answer? No. No. But do you remember when you started to use Facebook? Google? In 2008? Okay. Interesting. Apart from that, that is interesting, you also understand this case. It's not so fundamental, rather than the Coste Rosales, we will receive a question on Coste Rosales, but it's an example that you can use in the written answer that you will have to make some clear example. Another suggestion for the exam. Remember that I will start now to make this kind of suggestion that it's not important to write too much, but it's also important not to answer just on two lines. The real problem that I see in last year was that I received some answer that was about three pages, four pages of answer. It's complicated because it's really difficult to write three pages, but anyway there is a risk to make a lot of mistakes. So the good way my suggestion is to be, we can say one page and also less, half page is absolutely enough. Obviously you have to use the word and put the answer in half page. But try to match in this kind of exam could be a risky issue. Not to write too much, but to write the right things. It's not so important because basically the questioner, not yes or no, obviously are open questions, but you don't need to go too much around and you need to be strategic with the point. My suggestion is sorry, but perhaps would you feel free. So we have 30 minutes, 25 minutes, so we start to introduce GDPR. Now we made this kind of first lecture for the introduction. Nobody has talked about GDPR. Alessandro, Antonio, sure. Okay, just to be sure that I don't indicate information. What is GDPR? General Data Protection Regulation is a regulation in EU law on data protection in privacy. It's a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individu

als who live in the European Union and starting on May 2018. Just a quick information regarding the difference between a directive or a regulation. It's for everybody of you, but especially for the European citizen. But it's also important to know the regulation is immediately applicable to every European citizen. Obviously also, for example, to an Iranian citizen that lives in Europe, for example. But anyway, the point is it is immediately applicable. So, Brussels decides and every single member states has to apply this rule. When there is a directive, you will see always, you hear perhaps about directive, the European directive, is. Brussels says, okay, you have to write this law on the basis of the directive and every single states has to slash three years to apply the law in its country, its country. So, the regulation is the same for every single member states. The directive could be different because every single states could apply its personal law. This is the huge difference that we have with respect to the United States where the US federal law are absolutely the principality and there is a unique law in every single states of the United States. In Europe there is a lot of mess because we have the regulation, but we have really the part of the European legislation is made by regulation. The most of the legislation is made by direct. So, every single member states does what he wants, basically, do what he wants. This is the problem that we have in Europe. But why I mention this difference? Because in the case of GDPR and then in the case of digital services, there is another law that if I have time I will explain to you the least regulation. This is a good thing because it is immediately applicable to every single citizen. Then what are the goals of EU general data protection regulation to protect personal data and strengthen privacy rights of EU individuals and then give users control over their data. So, control and protection. These are the two goals of the general data protection regulation. What are the article one that is basically something that is already said, but I want to again explain this principle because there are some principles that are really important. The regulation laid down rules relating to the protection of the person. With regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating the free movement of personal data. So, basically, we have this principle that is the free movement not only of the physical person, because as you know if you are a European citizen you can go around the world, around Europe without any imitation. But there is also the free movement of personal data. So, the possibility to exchange data around Europe. The regulation protects fundamental rights and freedom of the person. And the free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reason connected with the protection of natural person with regard to the processing of personal data. So, we have these two principle important, the important principle. The first one is the free movement of personal data in Europe. And the second, perhaps more important, that the first is that the GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation, is applicable only to the physical person. So, it's really important that you understand this, because sometimes you will make confusion in the exam and I want to be clear. So, please pay attention for this kind of for the next five minutes. The General Data Protection Regulation is applicable, so the protection is for the physical person. For example, in a university you are the physical person, the data subject, and the data controller, the person that controls your data is in the university, is the polytechnic of Turin, that is the legal entity. So, polytechnic of Turin, that is a legal entity, is the data controller, so is the person that should respect the GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation. And the General Data Protection Regulation protects the physical person. So, when I ask you, who has to apply the GDPR, the answer is the legal entity, not the physical person. For examp

le, I ask you, if you use the information, because we are in Europe, so we respect the European legislation, if now you start to use the information of your friends and your students and you publish the information without a consent or a e-s consent online, you can be sanctioned for the GDPR or not. No, because you should be a legal entity, okay? This is important. There is some exception, there is some exception, but this is not a course when we need to go in depth. So, if you are interested, I will go, the person that is interested, on the exception. The general rules is, you can do whatever you want if you are a physical person, that is not a good thing to say, because you can have a lot of other risk, there is not only data protection, data protection. The only subject that should respect data protection is a legal entity, is a company. Google has to respect data protection. Mercedes or Ferrari, as we mentioned before, Formula One, has to respect data protection of this client. But the data protection should be applicable and should protect, I could say better, the physical person, the physical person, not the legal entity. So, if I am a company and I process data of another company, not of a physical person of the company, but of another company, I could, there is no application of GDPR, because there are two entities. The application of GDPR is only between legal entity to a data subject that is a physical person. Sorry if I repeat this concept a lot of time, but just to be clear, because this would be a mistake that you can commit when you write an answer. This is a big mistake. Then, who is affected by GDPR? All business, collecting, or holding personal data on people, so physical person, who are located in you and EDA. No matter where they are assigned, nor their citizenship. That's why I told you that now you can have the application of the GDPR, because you are in the Italian territory. So, the territorial scope is that companies that are not established in the union, but are subject to the GDPR shall designate a representative in the union, Article 27. So, this is quite complex, it's not fundamental, I know that you are a little bit tired at 7 o'clock, so just to try to simplify this principle, but please remember the other one. The other one is really, really, really important. This principle is about the territorial scope. The territorial scope means that if you are a European, sorry, a US platform, we also say, we are going to say Zoom, that is a US platform. I don't know if it's the company that does Zoom, it's not the company, I don't remember the name of the company, it's Zoom. But anyway, we can call it Zoom, and you are this US company, and you have clients around Europe, a lot of clients around Europe that use Zoom. So, you need to have, if you want to do the business in Europe, so if you are from China, if you are from Russia, if you are from Ukraine, if you are from the United States, you have to do, you have to appoint a person that is the legal representative of your company in Europe. Okay, so you can be, obviously it should be a company, it should be a legal entity, but it could be also a person that has a VAT, it could be a taxable person, this is the right definition. And then you can say, okay, I am a US company, I am a Iranian company, I am an Egyptian company, my legal representative in Italy is Giuseppe Raccioli, he is another person, or he is a company. It depends on what is the size and the complexity of this kind of company. So, when you have, for example, Google, they say that its legal representative in Europe is Google Island. Why Google Island? Because there is no many pressure from a tax and data protection activity, because there is not a strong data protection commissioner, because it doesn't have so many employees. And also from a tax perspective, it is really useful to have an entity in Ireland with broader than Italy. So they decided to use a legal representative in Europe. You don't need to have a legal representative in any single member states, you just choose one. This is the article 27, so you need to appoin

t a person. And this is a request that is quite aggressive in a certain sense, because you don't have the same regulation around the world. For example, in the US, you have a data protection law that is called CCBA, because it is the California Pias Act. And for the time being, it is just in California, but in California there are a lot of companies that are quite sensitive regarding data protection. But they don't have this kind of obligation, so you don't need to appoint a United States legal representative. The same you have also in the legislation in Brazil that is really similar to the GDPR, but at the same time they are not so aggressive, I could say like Europe. And this is a strategy of Europe that I don't know if it's a right strategy, because the good point is that Europe is really pay attention to this kind of principle and to this kind of law. And I think that it's important to have a balance, especially in this specific period of time when there is a lot of risk to have war or other big, big conflicts that are not only a potential war, but also economic conflicts or also ethical conflicts, because when we have AI, we will have to discuss about ethical issue and what we want to do as a citizen of the world of this kind of incredible power that you probably will manage more than AI or other activities. So you have this kind of greater responsibility and Europe decided to be really, really severe, really to pay a lot of attention, to give a lot of attention to this kind of point. But at the same time you have US and the regulation that you have in US that is paying a lot of attention to the, not only to the economic purposes, but to the commercial contracts law, so to regulate in a clear way the business. And then you have China that has a regulation that from one to tell you the truth, the China regulation has some ethical point, but is absolutely more pay a lot of attention to help the growth of this kind of business. So the state has to help Chinese company to growth on AI business or anyway any business related to data. So we have these three different perspectives in the world that we have at the middle is a question where the law is more evaluated and at the west of the world we have more attention on business. I don't know what is the right way. I can tell you for sure that now the business is on the west and on the east side, but in the middle, at this kind of opinion, that we don't have so much business because basically all the data, all the European data are managed by US company. And this is the answer that we have. So perhaps we have a lot of rules, but we don't have the data. I don't know at the very end of the day what is more important to have data or to have regulation. I leave you the answer. But anyway, the fact from a legal standpoint is that we are more and more aggressive rather than other countries to ask the respect of the fundamental right. I don't know if this is the right way. Perhaps in the next 20 years we will see that this decision, this politics, because this is a politics decision is right. For the time being it's not so effective, especially from the economic perspective. We are basically market now. Yes. Yes. I don't know why there are too many lawyers and too less scientists. Why? Why it's a decision? Because from one side you can say the economy is important, the business is important, but also the economy is important. The fundamental right is important. So my answer could be that we need to have a safeguard for all the European citizens to be the truth of the record because our 630 in the afternoon, everything that we are all tired of is really easy for each person to create and to protect fundamental right. When you are not rich and when you need to create business, it's more important to business. So when you think that some place in the world, think that China grows like this because they start in expression where they don't have the same level of Europe like business and now they have a lot of business. But why? Because they need the business. They want to have something that the world doesn't give. So bas

ically the point is that it depends on what is the economy. We are too lucky depending on the economy. So we can have the benefit, the luxury, to think at the fundamental right. But when you don't have to eat every single day, the fundamental right is to have the money to take the food in the supermarket and not to think at the fundamental right. So this is the big mistake perhaps that Europe made. But this is just a view of a person that is a little bit tired and at 630 in the afternoon. The other point of view is that we protect fundamental right and this is correct. I leave you with the final decision. But I think that there is, in these two opinions, there is elements of truth because every time that I see the decision of the European Court of Justice, I mention the mostly decision, I think that they are decisions that are made by a rich person. And this is something that we have to remember every single day because the decision of a rich person could be more different, absolutely different from a decision made by a poor person. This is something that we have to remember. Because if you don't see this, if you don't have the, if you are not brave, if you say, you know, I don't want to, if you don't, sometimes you have to be in the position to say what is the truth. I think that the truth is in the world and not under, because if you use fundamental right to avoid the truth, it's not to respect the fundamental right. It's just an excuse the fundamental right. This is the point. If you use the fundamental right to respect the fact that everybody is the same, everybody is the same. This is the right way to use the fundamental right. But when you use the fundamental right to exclude someone, I don't think that it's the right way. Anyway, I'm telling you that to export the audio, you have to export the audio. This is the way to process the processing of personal data in the context of the activity of an establishment of a control or procession in the European Union. So, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not, the activity of the processing takes place in the Union or not. The activity of the processing takes place in the Union or not. The activity of the processing takes place in the Union or not. Basically, the same principle. So, don't worry. It's something that we have already said, explained. We use again the Coste decision to have an example. It's just to say you can be Google, but you should not say I'm in the US so I don't respect the European law. Because Google uses data of European citizens. So, as to respect the European law. So, that's the territorial scope and the territorial principle. And then again, the regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subject while in the Union by a control or procession not established in the Union, where the processing activity are related to offering of good services, with respect to the payment of the data subject required and the monitoring of their behavior as far as the behavior takes place within the Union. So, basically, in a specification of what is the activity of the platform of the player, the data controller that are not present in Europe. So, they have the offering of goods or services and then the monitoring of the behavior takes place in the Union. So, these are two conditions to apply the territorial scope. It's important that this slide, if you want to go in detail of the territorial scope. But the simple way to answer is obviously the European legislation, the GDPR applies to any member states and also for any states that give services or goods in Europe. This is basically the main answer. If you want to be really precise if you use this slide. Then, we can finish with the personal data definition and then we can go then tomorrow with the more precise classification and some cases regarding the personal data. The article 4 says that personal data means any information relating to an identifier or identifiable person or identifiable person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly. In particular, by reference to an identifier such as name,

identification number, location data and online identifier. One or more factors specific to the physical, physical, analytical, mental, economic, cultural, social identity of dead, natural, and worse. What is personal data? The simple way is any data that could directly or indirectly identify you. So, this is the simple way to define personal data. Two lines. The answer is correct. Then you can also go in depth and you have this definition of the article 4. What I want to explain to you so you can understand how is tricky personal data because it's something, as I mentioned before when I talked about the data subject right. This is something that could happen to you if you're in your professional activity and what you will do tomorrow. It's the fact that the personal data is also an IP address. And this makes me crazy because for me an IP address is not a personal data. A dynamic IP address is not a personal data because as you know I always change my IP when I make internet connection. So it's not possible to identify. I will spread some of you and can answer. Is it possible to identify a person with an IP? First question. Why not? There is a yes at the bottom. Why yes? You can identify the devices that belong to personal data. So basically you can with the IP. Also the geolocation. You can detect the place where the query of the search was made with the IP. Yes sir. You can even though you can understand the problem. Yes, they can but when you talk about the geolocation of the IP there is a lot of tools that are not really strong and hacky tools. They give you approximately the location just to answer the point that you mentioned before. But you cannot exactly know who is the person. But the reason you can work around that you can do is from the IP address that basically could be given also by Google for example. Because when you go online, you have a Gmail, you can also have Google take this information. You can also have the network. Perhaps this was your answer but they did not have the network provider. Because the network provider can find them when you go online and then give you the information of the person that pays physically the invoice on the network. So you have a physical person. So you have to first point to identify a person. You have to know the IP. When you know the IP you can know the network provider. Perhaps I can use tools but also it's really simple to know the network provider. When you saw with information a network provider that could be for example in Italy, team or Vodafone that is a worldwide network provider you call Vodafone and say okay I want to know who is the person that made the connection at 6pm at the Polytechnic of 3. At that time with this IP and then they told you, sorry, who is the person that is the controller of the voice. But this does not mean that it happens that my son for example, I pay the invoice of the Vodafone of my son. So they will give information of me but not of my son. Let me understand what I mean with how it works. Okay, if you don't understand. Because this is quite important to understand why I am a little bit upset with this definition. But it depends from my point of view and IP address identify and learn to be the person. Even if we do not have a certain, I tell you a case just to tell you why I am a little bit crazy about this fact. Because there was a typography case in Verona and then there was a professor that was invited, investigated for typography content on his laptop, sorry not on his laptop, because he went on the website where there was this kind of content and then he started to have this incredible proceeding and he always said that he was absolutely not guilty. What happened? That basically he had a Wi-Fi connection again that was not protected and the neighbor used that Wi-Fi connection and the neighbor was the person that went to the typography website and not the professor. But the judge because the voice was, the IP address was connected to the person. He didn't understand that there was the possibility that perhaps you can use the connection of another person. This is one

of the examples to explain or the other example is the fact that you pay an invoice of your son and then you could be liable for a crime committed by your son. So that's why I don't think that an IP address is the personal data. But again the data protection authority, the law says that an IP address is a personal data. You say why so concentrate the personal data because it has a real impact and this is the maximum example of data that could identify you undirectly. So again the point is personal data is something that could be directly, so your last name is something that could directly identify you, but also undirectly. On the basis of a lot of factors, one of these is for example an IP address, but you can also be identified by location data because yes, coming back to your answer at the bottom, you can perhaps say you can be the only one that has an internet connection in a certain area. This could be really difficult to get at but it could theoretically happen. So a genetic, mental, economic, cultural, social and identified of that metro address. So this is the definition of personal and identified information. There is a difference between obviously the US legislation and the EU legislation. The EU legislation is limited to scope, sorry, the US legislation has limited scope address, such as security number, banking information, zip code. For example, banking information in the European legislation are not so considered as personal data if they are only, let's say, the part of the number, but at the same time I think that when you talk about a bank account, you are absolutely more sensitive about your bank account rather than other information regarding your personal information. And then obviously the definition of the ESO standard is any piece of information that confirms an individual identity. So coming back to the beginning and then we are finished and then you can go to have a wonderful period. What we have done today, the definition of privacy, what I mean by this, is that it's coming back to the try to be at the loan. So these two guys 100 years ago, they understood what was privacy or privacy, everyone saying the UK way. Then we have the declaration, you can remember this declaration, absolutely useful. Remember the one of the article 8 of the European Convention and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. These are two slides that are to be really important. Then we go through the costeia and I explain you the balance of interest that is also explained in the general principle that I mentioned before, but you can use when the question would be balancing of interest, you have to remember immediately Google costeia and then every single thing that I explain you about Google costeia. And then after that, mostly it's another case that it's important, but it's not fundamental because it's another idea of the Google. Then what is the GDPR? Remember the number, remember the date, it's important. So, sorry, 69 of 2016 and started from May 25, 2018. And then the two goals, it's important, protection and control. Then obviously we have the two principles, the general and the protection principle, free movement, environmental rights, and then the territorial scope. At the very end, we have explained the definition of personal data and then you have to remember directly or indirectly identify you. So this is the things that you have to remember about personal data, and directly, because it's simple to say your name is an identifiable pattern or it's difficult to think that some other information can identify you even if there is no, there is no your name. Okay, see you on Monday.
