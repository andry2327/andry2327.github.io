 you Good morning everybody can you hear me? Yes, okay the plan for this week is the following one today we will finish the compass case having a closer look to the data sources used by the compass algorithm and then we will have an overview on a complementary approach to fairness to quantitative computations of fairness which is the fairness qualitative assessment tomorrow we will have the first session of exercises that will be devoted mostly to explanations of discrimination issues we will solve one past exam together and then I will give you two at least two former exams as exercises to solve by yourself but I will explain you in details tomorrow so this is the the plan of the week and from now on we will have only theory in the Mondays and exercises three hours of exercise every Tuesday so this won't change until the end of the course okay let me assume last part of the compass case from a couple of considerations the first one is that the compass case had the performances that were the compass algorithm sorry had performances that were comparable to those of human judgments there was a study here you can find the link if you want for your own curiosity to delve into details the study showed that regarding both accuracy and both in terms of false positives and false negatives the performances of human judgments were in terms of accuracy basically the same even a slightly better than the compass algorithm both for black defendant as you can see the black bars and for white defendants and this is something that should be taken into account when automating a decision process there should be all comparison results after the system is either tested or deployed for a while it should be always compared back to the results obtained by the human process to understand the what's what are the benefits the actual benefits and what should be improved in the automatic process regarding the false positive the human judgment quite outperformed the the compass the compass case well not sorry the compass case slightly outperformed the human the human judgment for black defendants and vice versa there was a slight improvement on the you on white cases from the human judgment as you can see finally as far as false negatives are concerned for white the compass case was was about 10% better compass algorithm sorry keeping saying a compass case was the same level for what black defendants the black bars so not a great achievement in terms of performances then ways of automation as you can as I already said there are there are documents that reveal the variables used by the compass case by the compass algorithm however the actual algorithm that was used is a black box was not it's not published public however it was studied whether a logistic regression a very simple logistic regression using all the hundred and thirty seven features was better was performing better than simple algorithms that are case a a logistic regression LR with only seven features a logistic regression LR again with only two features support vector machines with machine with seven feature nonlinear super vector machine and then the last term of comparison is the compass case why doing such an experiment because in we have especially in Europe less in the United States but we have quite universally agreed that at least in terms of good practices on data minimization you should collect only the data that is strictly necessary for your prediction goals hundred and thirty seven features are a lot especially when features are very sensitive data as you will see in a while so the goal of this study was to understand whether the data minimization principle was used in compass and what what were the performances

achievable by much simpler models let's have a look only at the first row accuracy overall the overall accuracy reached by a linear regression with only seven features instead of hundred and thirty seven case the is the same basically 66 percent with a confidence interval of 95 percent around 64 and 68 and we're using the same variables as compass 65 percent again this is not I want to stress because it's important to understand I want to set the fact that this is not the real compass algorithm was built a regress logistic regression using all the features used in the compass algorithm so important to understand this difference a logistic regression with only two features reached again the same accuracy level 66 percent slightly lower but same range the support non-linear support vector machine whether when result when accuracy was segmented analyzed in subgroups black and white the findings are very similar as you can see 66 percent again and 66 percent for the logistic regression with seven features same level with two features and about compass we have again similar values with only accuracy for white that is slightly higher 67 percent and slightly lower than previously for black people if we look at the false positive third and four and a fourth row for black again we have that the best accuracy the best well not sorry the percentage the highest percentage was 45 percent logistic regression with two features but is not so far away from the forty four dot eight percent of compass for disease for percentage of false positive for black the best result was reached with support vector machine also in terms of false positive for white 20 percent regarding the false negative the support of the machine performed worst compass a 28 percent and the simpler logistic regression reached a minimum of 21 percent for white we had higher percentages of false negatives and this is in line with the problem of compass where false negatives were were higher for for white this is an advantage because you are not predicted as a high-risk why you are are a CDVs 47 percent for compass and that is the same basically as for the other logistic regression a bit better than support vector machine of course I will never ask you about the percentages but the takeaway is that you could achieve similar results or even better using a much less data and why using a much like less data we will have now a closer look to the data sources of compass to understand why it is important from the point of view of at least of human dignity to use a less data yes yes I'm not not always overlapping but mostly yes they are and this confirms what's yes this observation is right thank you and this confirms that you could use a more simple model using less data about individual so yes you're right I don't but I cannot say that from the legal point of view you can take the average value about all the results from the legal point of view I cannot really answer because first of all from a point of view competencies you know that I'm not a legal scholar any anyway we are we don't have but I can tell you for sure that there are no legal requirements that are quantitatively specified equity fairness are concepts that are not that are much more than a computation that are an equivalence of false positives having a way to compute fairness is is a good point is a good start at least but it's not sufficient as a criterion the problem is much more complex so from from the legal point of view we cannot say that we can take the average of course we can say that is what the data minimization principle was not followed and why it should be important to use a such a principle let me share another documents now that you sh

ould already have in your in your the material okay this is the an example of a risk assessment that is filled partially by the defendant and partially is profiled or filled by a police and this is the source data used by the compass algorithm we have a very personal information which serve to for for identification purposes we have track of the gender we have track of marital status that is a protected attributes then we have several sections we'll now I will now have an overview on the several sections and then we will have a closer look to the questions on each section so first of all a descriptive section on the current charges so why the defendant is what is the crime for which the defendant has to to go under judgment then a look into the history of the defendant what is the criminal history of the defendant and you have several questions then you have several other questions that regards what is the social context of the defendant and the criminal history also is connected to this so family criminality is a section peers criminality among the peers friends for instance then we have a section on abuse of substances residence stability of life for example job social environment education work vocation free use of free time leisure recreation proxies of social isolation criminal personality so questions from the psychological point of view what this is a subset as it related to the to the psychological emotions so related to the psychology of the individual criminal attitude as well and so this is the end of hundred and thirty seven the features used so imagine that you have for each people for each person such a sheet that is updated every time a person goes is stopped and is under judgment such a sheet is updated partially is filled by the person who is under judgment partially is filled by profiled by police because let's have a look to the current charges this is a description of why the person is under judgment the current charges is assault with weapons as you can see both options are ticked plus other minor charges and then a description of the of the of the crime do any current offices involve family violence yes or not which category of the following's apply to the to the current charge misdemeanor nonviolent felony or violent felony so it's a violent crime but not involving family violent crime with weapons these are assaults was this person on probation or parole the time of the current office so whether this person was already benefiting of an alternative sanction in this case was probation to be parole probation both or neither is this person a suspected or admitted gang member yes or no and this case yes number of pending charges so how many other charges are pending on the individual in this case known and is the is the current of charge felony property of fraud in this case no so these are descriptions of the crime and this is turned into a variable into a feature then we go we make a step towards more personal aspects how many times has this person been arrested before this is profiled the five five more times was in the database for arrest how many prior juvenile felony offenses are rest free so three out of four sorry four four out of five were a eunuch crimes and more than two were violent so these are additional data on the history historical crime then let's go let's let's move beyond to other more interesting questions we now move to the family criminality so we move to the family's fair individual sphere of the person so which of the following best describes who principally raised you so here it is the person who is filling the the questionnaire both natural parents natural mother only natural father only relatives adoptive parents

 foster parents other arrangements the fact that the way you were raised that might have an impact on your criminality is an aspect that is important for judges to understand the causes that brought the personal talk to a crime to make a crime vulnerability for instance past history difficult family history so there are all elements that are important for the judge to understand what are the what is the what are the base causes the vulnerabilities at the base of the life of an individual but this is very different for taking this information turn it into a variable and make make a prediction with these and other informations because if this aspect is statistical will be a statistical significant predictor it means that any individual with these kind of personal characteristics for instance raised by adoptive parents let's say that this is this will be this level of the variable will be significant but it also means that whenever you have you are these characteristics you are raised by adoptive parents you are somehow more probable to receive a high risk but it's very different to use this information to understand what are the causes under behind a crime or the attitude of criminality and making extracting patterns and using these statistical patterns to make individual predictions because as we have seen in the very in the nectar the end example of the old lady and the lawyer you may you might end up in errors or you might end up more generally in making discriminations just because of personal characteristics characteristic of your own life just because I was raised by adoptive parents I have more probability to receive a high risk you see there is a huge difference when you turn information that should be used in a qualitative way in to a rough statistical pattern then let's go ahead there are no questions on this important difference no question okay then if you lived with both parents and then later separated how old were you at the time less than five five to ten eleven to fourteen fifteen or older same considerations why is this information should be turned to make an individual prediction it's important to understand the whole environment social environment in which a person raised in which could she could encounter difficulties in life but can be easily become an automatic discrimination if one of these levels will be an important factor for the prediction was your father ever arrested yes or no was your mother ever arrested yes or no where your brothers or sister ever arrested yes or no about the same questions on your wife husband parents did a parent or parent figure who raised you even have a drug or alcohol problem was one of your parents ever sent to jail or prison yes or no then similar questions to your peers how many of your friends acquaintances have ever been arrested half most few known about whether they serve time in jail or prison whether they are gang members whether they take legal drugs regularly whether the person you have ever been a gang member and if you are now a gang member two comments on this kind of questions first one we are under a legal context in which you are required to tell the truth any legal context required that you tell the truth but US legal settings as well as UK legal settings place an important aspects an important relevance on this aspect you if you anybody of you took a flight towards the United States in order to get permission to enter you need to declare that you are not a terrorist this is my seems strange to a different coming from different context but these as very to this quiz to that question first of all is mandatory secondly is important because in that legal in that legal context you are taking

responsibility towards that's a data session so if you are in case if you are a terrorist and you declare that you are not you're then your charge will be much much higher the same and lower context but as that is that follow the same principles as a student in any English University of the United States University you must follow an ethical code of conduct and if you are caught in let's say don't say copying but infringing the ethical code of conduct you are out of the university even cases of copying exams on breaking the rules of the exams we know that different social context and different legal context make the rule of the ethical rule of conduct of conduct less less relevant of many of you read carefully the polytechnic code of conduct for students you see the difference between relevance puts it to this kind of code of conducts admins admittance of certain aspects like this so you are a legal pressure in this kind of questioners to tell the truth on the same time if you don't don't feel this legal pressure and if you know that this data might be used against you for instance to make to make a decision about staying in prison or not to make a decision about the severity of your crime or to make a decision that take into account your mental level your mental sanity level then you might for the good art law you might be pushed to not to tell the truth here because you self-filled these all these questions so you might say I'm not a gang member because you might know you might suspect that this element would put more severity into your crime or or you might have fear to say that you are a gang member because once you are out of prison your other gang members might might make some actions on you because you declared that you are a member of a gang etc etc so these observations have the goal to reflect on the reliability of this type of data could be high from an aspect and the low from from from other points of view substance abuse what are your usual habits in use using alcohol or drugs do you have current legal problems because you you use alcohol drugs yes or no where you using alcohol when you were arrested in this case yes and what about the the drugs are you following treatment for alcohol or drugs such as consuling at patients in patient residential etc then residence stability how often do you have contact with your family daily once per week less than once never no family but remember this variable then turns this information then is turned into a variable and if it is statistical significant you are building a risk or based on even on this kind of information how often have you moved in the last 12 months do you have a regular living situation how long have you been living at your current address do you live with friends yes or no do you live alone etc then social environment is there much crime in your neighborhood yes or no do some of your friends or family feel they must carry a weapon to protect themselves in your neighborhood and in your neighborhood have some of your friends or family being crime victims do some of the people in your neighborhood feel they needed to carry a weapon for protection is it easy to get drugs in your neighborhood are their gangs in your neighborhood I read all of them because it is important to understand that the either whether this one of these variables again is will be statistically significant for prediction then the fact that you live in a certain neighborhood will determine high probability of getting a high risk and this is a pure discrimination issue then you will get information on your past education whether you completed the high school what was your final grade the usual grades in high school and etc w

hether you have a job then aspects about work whether you have a job whether you have currently have a skill to find a work how many times you have you been fired from a job etc how you use your feel your free time how often did you feel bored never several times several times per month several times per weeks daily how often did you feel you have nothing to do in your spare time etc social isolation here there are sentences in which you have to declare whether you are you agree or not and plus intermediate levels I have friends who help me when I have troubles agreed is agree I feel lonely I have friends who enjoy in doing things with me etc criminal personality same type of questions I am seen by others as cold and unfeeling I always practice what I preach I'm really good at talking my way out of problems etc anger specific longer some people see me as a violent person I almost never lose my temper if people make me angry or lost my temper I can be dangerous etc same types of questions related to criminal attitude as a hungry person as a right to steal when people are getting to travel with law it's because they have no chance to get a decent job so I might be agree I might agree with this sentence and I think it's nothing to do with a criminal attitude but this is typical sentences used by psychologists to understand what are the potentiality your potentiality is is is a criminal and so so I wanted to spend some time with you to read these questions and then I strongly encourage you to have a look at the document to understand what were the features used and to let you reflect on the aspects that I mentioned it no minimization of data collection data that were was collected for a purpose and then used for another purpose data that it was collected for understanding the person and the case because this is the the work of the judge the judge is not only asked to apply the law but is asked to apply the law given the circumsustance of the crime and these variables are then turned into this this information is then turned into variables we have seen that there are reliability issues and the last button on the list you get discrimination issues because statistical patterns may inform a prediction based on personal characteristics okay let's close the the compass case just with a summary of the issues using a schema that is that you can find here where one of each of these aspects are explained first of all intervention versus prediction even if you have a high you can get a high accuracy or predictions and this was not the case in compass at least for for certain subgroups you are not solving the problem of recidivism you are just predicting the probability of being reassert rearrested and that this is linked with the second aspect target construct mismatch you have a construct and this is a measurement bias you don't on the target variable because you you are not really measuring recidivism you are measuring the probability of of being rearrested that is different from recidivism you might have in compass I had the distribution shift that is evaluation bias because of using data from a specific range of time and then keep using the model for a while and also for geographical differences in the criminality we have seen that compass was really comparable to linear models the performances were comparable to linear models with only two features or if or with seven features we have seen that there was a lack of independence and separation the calm the model was calibrated but not the not satisfy independent separation then the subjects could not contest to not challenge and contest the the the information and even the decision they were not aware even of a risk or o

n them and then good at throw what I was just mentioned earlier you might as a defendant be pushed to change your answers to the questions cause several factors because you don't want to to be in troubles after you are out of jail because you would like to change the to influence the decision of the judge etc etc you could never know what is in the mind of a person under judgment to when answering such personal questions so you might lie on your personal history in a way or in the other in order to influence the judge okay as I said on last Tuesday valuation of fairness yes please okay thanks for the question let me make a step behind so I repeat the questions so that it will be recorded the question was how compass well the company that developed compass could handle the issue of reliability of answers whether a person could lie or not first of all I was probably not clear in the premises the data that you have seen is not the data that comes from the company that developed compass this is the data that every defendant has to fill in a given district in the US when you are arrested stopped by police and you are now the the judgment start you have first of all to fill a questionnaire part of the questionnaire is filled directly by the police employees because it's historical data on your criminal history how many prior offenses then you are as a defendant as have to fill the questionnaire there is no way to access whether you are lying or not police might collect all criminal or criminal records like this that you filled and the check the consistency but we don't know at least there is no evidence that this is performed equivalent that is the company that produced the compass so have no way to access the reliability of the answers and the ability to the source data because this is data coming from the police departments so this aspect was not taken at all into account did I answer okay please okay let me explain better what is why it is called low it is a both an empirical law and a law from the point of view of sociology even anthropology because about the human behavior it's not so i'm using the term i use the term law because in this disciplines is a is called a law an empirical law means that you have data you have observations that are both in quantity and in quality enough to take this phenomenon as real to consider it as a kind of a law it's not a physical law not a legal law but it is a pattern that is was observed was explained so many times that can be considered as an empirical law because again observations were were extended were quite extensive case studies quantitative studies etc and so in these terms is the law is the is called a law not because it is in our legal is a validity of legal law did i answer or not if i didn't i did not answer i can try to be more precise was not your question what was the point of your question yes i spent quite a lot of time on the good arts law and the reflexivity problem the good arts law i also call the cobras effect some of you were present on the intellectual about the measurement issues measurement process you just you will find in the slides yeah but it was a good occasion to specify the term law thanks we're seeing adjusted to close this the parent is on this question we see the reflexivity problem campus law whenever an indicator is used for an evaluation of a person of a good person will be subjected to social pressure social corruption is also called in technical terms you try to change your behavior in order to optimize that indicator that will be used against you and I made you several examples the good arts law is a relative of the campus law or reflexivity problem whenever you your measure becomes

 a target then it sees this to be a good measure because of the phenomena that I showed you and I also told you the anecdote about the cobra effect about British the British government in India that took action to try to reduce the number of cobras with the opposite result the other part of today's lecture will be devoted to a different slightly different way to access the fairness of an algorithm system it's called the fairness qualitative assessment it's a very very simple way that's made of four questions it should be considered as a very first step in the assessment risk assessment or impact assessment depending on whether you make it you use it before system deployment or after system deployment and this is an example of using a mix of ethical approaches to the assessment of fairness with if you remember when I showed you criteria for fairness evaluation quantitative criteria for fairness evaluation I told you that these criteria are this approach means that you compute statistical computations of fairness are below the umbrella of consequentialism this was one of the three main approaches for normative ethics the very beginning of this course I told the second part of the course I told you that that we are approaching data ethics from the point of view of normative ethics normative ethics at three main sub approaches consequentialism you focus on the consequences of a given action so a given algorithm and we have seen you can do it statistically with the fairness criteria and then virtue ethics that is you start from the values the virtues from the development or desired shared values that then translated into mechanism in this case into algorithms the third the third was the ontology you end up with a set of rules code of conduct for professionals in the in the real most of the development we will deal with the ontology is probably at the very last theory lecture today this is an example how to mix a bit of consequentialism with virtue ethics and it is and we'll do is we'll do it with the fairness qualitative assessment as I said it is in the middle between algorithm risk assessment or algorithm impact evaluation the difference is that you make a risk assessment before you deploy your system in design phase you you make an impact evaluation usually after or when your system is under testing or under deployment you can do both you can use the the FQA in both cases the goal is to identify issues of fairness as I said in both design phase during after deployment everybody can use it both who is developing the system or external auditors or observers of a given of a given system the questions are for and are the following one and with an example we will we'll run an example through the four questions to understand how how the assessment can be done first of all what what social conflicts arise when you design or and operate a system and among the social conflicts which stakeholders are adversely affected by by this conflict who is winning who is losing who is concerned how why what values social interest are at stake in these in these implications for stakeholders and how you could mitigate if not solve at all these conflicts of interest so these four questions we use as a running example safe router safe router is probably still used but not sure an app basically a service digital service that is was designed with data from criminal records of the city of edinburgh building a recommendation for itinerary urban itineraries in order to minimize the probability to incur into a crime as you can see here in the map there are areas of the city that are red others that are yellow other that are green other that are not filled at all and this is this can be seen

as either as a each map of the probability of the of the level of danger of a given area or similarly because the two things are connected the number of past crimes in a given area that instructed the the algorithm that the draw this map of danger in a given area so if you want to go this means that if a person using this app says that wants to go from a to b that is here b is here hey it's here the algorithm will probably try to minimize the number of times here to go through a red area so can suggest something like this something like this if you can also have to say if you put some some constraints on time so not probably something like this because it takes too much but if you want a safe route you use this recommendation algorithm that is built on top of historical crime data is it clear now we apply the four questions on this algorithm what such a conflicts arise from a design and operation of such a system we use a table that is well known by you again this Taylor raster diagram but it was also a confusion matrix you have on the top the predictions that can be negative or positive and you have an event can be positive or negative present or absent and in you have the errors on these cells whenever you are negative predictions but the positive event we have a false negative vice versa you have a false positive this should be something super clear to you in this case we can say that the prediction is a low risk of assault or high risk of assault and the event is and this is difficult to to to compute this is an intrinsic limitation of such kind of social outcome prediction that is there was a crime or not or there were the circumstances for a crime or not or there was no assault it is very difficult to build even such a simple table with this kind of app because how can you know whether there would have been a crime if you passed through that area or you can simply track whether a crime was actually happened in a given range of time let's say in a week a month in that particular area so there is some practical difficulties in tracking whether the event of court or not but let's assume that we can use a reasonable proxy and so whenever you have a low risk of assault as a prediction and instead you had a crime happening that is that a dangerous area or circumstance was misclassified safe this is an error the other error is whenever you have a high risk of assault predictor but nothing happened so you made a longer route but was not necessary so safe areas misclassified as dangerous and then the complementary cells are whenever there was a high risk of assault and actually there was there could have been that the circumstances for a crime so danger avoided or no assault low risk of assault okay everything is clear was is correct safe area that is correct in the outlet and the social conflicts arise no occurrence of the errors so you have to this a methodology simple methodology ask you to to fill the table in terms of what happens what are the implications high level implications and then the following questions make you start from these identification of the errors not in numerical terms but in terms of what's what is the error about what are the implications so we may detail more what are the implications and then let you let's just go through in details on what is the impact of the risk of making these errors so first of all you have to identify what are who are the stakeholders that are that are impacted in a negative way but these conflicts stakeholders can be direct that those are the people who directly use the application or indirect the person who are not using the application might might be involved as well in the case of safer route the direct st

akeholders are the users of the app they might be we can reason about this but I think that we might it could be reasonable to say that people who have a deep knowledge of a city of a certain urban area do not need at all this kind this app could be extremely useful for tourists people who is new in the city or in a given neighborhood new residents etc women may use more often this app because they might because of their higher physical vulnerability they might need or they might feel they need the usage of this app well as a direct stakeholders all there are always the investor or the owners of the app but we made them implicit and basically we don't take them into account there are also indirect stakeholders that are residents that are living in in the city or at least in the areas that are that are ranked as dangerous not by the app also commercial activities that are located in those areas we identify them as indirect stakeholders and this is needed in order to answer the question which stakeholders are adversely affected and how if we look back to the table that was filled earlier we can say that false positives may impact mostly the business owners the owners of the business located in the areas that were classified wrongly as dangerous because they might have less people going through those areas is a massive usage of the app is in place or the residents again if many many people use the app your property might there might be a bad reputation about a certain neighborhood and your property might lose economic value in these terms so this is the way they might be impacted or not please notice that if you do these analysis at design phase you can try to counteract these these negative impacts but if you do these these analysis only after deployment then you need to wait at least a few years to have data reliable data and to check whether you are actually making this kind of impact on commercial activities and on residents is a well-known aspect in software engineering is that you have to devote enough time to the requirements phase because a change in the requirements documents and the design document costs much much less that's a change during after deployment if you need to change a functionality only in the design it's just a matter of a few hours but if you need to change the code then good luck if the system is already running or at least the cost much much more you need to change the code you need to run regression testing run again integration testing problems may arise and so on even in economical terms it's better to analyze things risk at design phase then let's move to the false negative here the stakeholders that are mostly affected by false negatives are the users of the app because you might go through an area because recommended by the algorithm that is indeed dangerous even if there are not criminal not enough criminal records but indeed it is dangerous well consider that let's not consider only violent crimes let's consider also when your bike gets stolen how many times you go to police to declare that a bike have been your bike has been stolen how many times this time of crime is reported not a lot of times not at all most of the time so this time of crime has a type of bias of course in the data collection and if the crime is stolen a bike you might you might go in an area recommended by the algorithm in which many bikes for some reason are stolen and your bike is also stolen so this is a false negative and you receive a loss of damage because you follow the recommendation algorithm and otherwise you would not pass the through that area so the the different stakeholders you can see that are affected differently by different type of erro

rs there are possibilities that affect at least in these very simple analysis mostly commercial activities and people living in the neighborhoods while false negative affect mostly the people who are using the app and then we could go as I did in this example we call more in details in details and make these considerations for all types of crimes because violent crimes are much much different from nonviolent crimes etc having identified the ways the culters are impacted by a poor performances of the system basically or types of error or the systems is very difficult that a system that predicts social outcomes will be able to have a zero percent of errors in false positive and false negative is impossible so you will always have some kind of impact but what are the social interests so the values that are at stake for these stakeholders in these in these cases so we need to speak about values what are values that principles of standards of a personal society the personal societal judgment of what is valuable and important in life can be or not related to ethics and morality and what's the priority of values that you put in values is what usually identify what you are or what you want to be what a society what are the principles that a society follows if you take the US constitution at the very beginning there are certain values that are declared internal safety of the of the country the value of happiness for every person as the right to pursue happiness in his life is her life is an example of values that are the very beginning then of a of a constitution then you get from values you have laws constitution as well as some principles that are values shared values at least on the paper and from those values the laws then follow so the values can apply to your individual life as a person to groups of people even at institutional level when we speak about discrimination usually we are principally mostly interested in human rights and human rights mostly interested in human welfare so opportunities denied given by automation or justice can be attributive distributive how you allocate resources for instance social justice this case but not exclusively this is just a note because most of the problems of that ethics that that we are seeing is our problems of this of discrimination it is impossible to avoid conflicts about values there are always conflicts or values should be managed a very short parenthesis that that is left to your own curiosity so this is not part content of the final that can be asked in the final exam if you have you ever known have you heard or have you ever played with the moral machine how many of you can you raise your hand okay i thought many more so is the this is an a philosophical dilemma has been turned into an experiment by a scientist of the MIT in which you can if you connect to this url you can make the test you will be asked to decide on 13 scenarios in which you have an autonomous vehicle that is in such a situation in which you can only you can only decide whether the vehicle should go straight so take no action and kill either some people on the street or the people inside the car or take an action and in order to avoid this this child you take action so the car that is autonomous should decide to to make a turn and the result the consequence will be killing a woman and all the lady so you are you will be asked 13 times questions that on this kind of choices the questions are randomized so every time you connect you get different questions and this is a very informative exercise because you will realize how values can easily inform design requirements software design requirements for instance it was it was found that in western so

cieties most people that took this kind of test made a privilege with respect to the youngest people so tried to avoid killing a child so saving the child and killing the lady the old lady in east east societies east side like china japan india was the reverse usually people taking the test saved the old lady and killed the young baby or younger persons this is because it's a different types of society that is built around the value of different values of greater relevance to old people social high social value of old people this was just an example of different cultural aspects and different values that belong that shape differently the culture the norms the law in terms of legal laws of societies hypothetically car that is able to recognize such kind of situations whether there is a all hypothetically here there is an old lady or a baby should be designed according to such kind of values sparing the old or sparing the baby so i live to your own curiosity and or otherwise given the very few took if there will be some spare time and some lecture or exercise we might even make a collective exercise experiment and making the test all together but for now is left to you and you will find that the slides in the slides some results about the values the different values according to different types of cultures i was saying countries with more individualistic cultures are more like to spare the young to spare more lives instead of less lives etc now let's go back to values there are infinite list of values and these philosophers Schwartz categorized the values in four macro categories openness to change is you give importance to self direct your own life to get stimuli on your life to make fun in your life hedonism self-financement achievement you want to to be better to build your own skills power you want to get power political power economical power you want to achieve that conservation you feel more you you value more security in your life or you more you you value a lot of tradition conformity to conformity to a given a set of rules norms and then self-transcendence attention of the new generations to the problems of the climate change are more towards these these quadrant universal is benevolence for the earth for not disrupting the environment older generations after the second world war were more on this on this were willing more this aspect so going up and up in the in the in the social year she but these are just examples of values and you can find other definitions of all the most specific values autonomy refers to people's ability to decide plan and acting ways that they believe will help them to achieve their own goals even your universal usability refers to making all people successful users of information technology this is a very specific value can be translated into technical requirements so leaving the definitions for further readings for you we can have values that are specifically supported by the software designers a startup for instance in torino here is working in the field of news collection of news from several newspapers and then presenting to you the most relevant news so that you you don't have to pay yearly subscriptions to all newspapers but you only pay a general subscription to category of sport for instance an explicit value that was supported and translated into design requirements but this type of was to put a limit in the number of recommendations in order to limit the time that you spend on the on your phone this is an example of value that you can push you and with with a software and translate directly in into software requirements as an individual designer you might also embed some value in your design you want a website that

is partially particularly well looking and so this is a value for you that is nice looking and you can translate it into technical requirements and then we might have values from all the stakeholders that might be elicited from stakeholders and then translate into software requirements all these had to be said because in our case whenever we have whenever we have the false negatives we have we are impacting economic security and the reputational value reputational capital let's say of residents of commercial activities people owning those commercial activities so these are the interests or values that are are impacted when in you are negative impact in this type of stakeholders in this particular case or in the other case for the false positives for the false negative sorry you are impacting the personal safety this is a value as we said of the particular stakeholders that we identified new residents tourists women etc how you balance these values of stakes this interest of stake how you can mitigate them different ways first of all you can try to understand what the people want because this is an applet is for the people is used by to increase the security of the people is a first goal and then there are your different ways of understanding what are what matters more for a given social group for a given population it is a jury it is an assembly jury is when you vote you ask selectors people from the from from different social groups select representatives of different social groups to to express their own interest you might make conferences with citizens you might make a polling a questionnaire you might so called make consensus conferences a series of conference conferences when you describe the problem you you describe several perspectives and the people then discuss the whole the whole citizenship the whole population can at least potentially can intervene these are all examples how you can ask ask people about these kind of aspects this is not new when you make the business plan in this case you try to understand what is the profitability of your software here you try to understand what are the different what are the values that are most important for the your target audience or you might you might go through for a more technical solution you might say okay I start running the software but I enable error reports from the people so the people can start putting their feedback directly on the app so that I can understand what's going on what's what is their feedback how they're using the app and trying during operation to retune the application and try to solve to mitigate the social tensions for instance I have a lot of complaints from people that get continuously bike stolen through the through the way and I can consider to retailer my application or I can prioritize based on values I say no this app is was built for the purpose of increase safety and I will try to maximize safety not taking into account of false negative even if they are 80 percent I don't care so this is an approach or you might say no I want to preserve the economical aspects economical value of properties of commercial activities and so I can I can calibrate even technically my my optimize sorry my my classification system towards this goal so these are just samples of actions that can be taken to so to mitigate or solve the value tensions that are that can arise from the execution of your or your system as you can see this is a puts a different light on the issue of fairness that is not only a matter of equilibrium of parity between a post positive probability of being predicted etc its specifications and predictions of social outcomes impact more more deeper aspects that need a more

 qualitative more qualitative reflections considerations and then actions if you take actions only on the base or statistical computation so you will be in troubles also because as I already said you can optimize for one criteria of fairness but not for the others so you need to you need to understand you need to use complete complementary tools and complementary points of view this is a very simple example of running a qualitative analysis for fairness okay this is all for today and tomorrow you will have the first round of exercises you
