 Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everybody. The lecture is going to start. Can you hear me? Yes? Okay. So, first starting let's go back for a very short recap on what you expect to do at the exam so that everything will be clear. And so I'm taking again the slides that I showed you the very first lecture. And I remind you that the content is what you see here. Basically, we covered all the fundamental concepts in that ethics. We will continue on some case studies and some other ethics and policy issues in on the Mondays appointments. We also with cases of biases in software systems and data but not from the theoretical point of view. We already covered the statistical formalization or aggregate fairness and we will, we will reflect towards the end of the course on a CM ethics, so I see and call the of ethics and professional so we from the point of view of the theory we covered almost everything and we will do some other case studies that are part of course of the exam. I remind you that the exam that I've sparked is is designed in a way that I can. I can test evaluate you against the. The following two goals understand the consequence for people in society for when deploying design deploying. And evaluate the risk or the impact of a DM systems, especially with a special eye on most vulnerable people. So you will get a case to solve that is will will in which I will basically evaluate you against this goal. And usually, if you perform good here you also perform good in the in the first goal that is checked with a theory question. So to one case with possible sub questions and a theory question with possible sub questions. And half points each. I remind you that is 45 minutes. You cannot bring nothing except the blank sheets. And I also remind you that the three shots of sufficiency is for each question is for that five is the 60% of seven dot five points. So if you have a good exam, you need to have a sufficient three questions out of four, because this is an interdisciplinary course and so we need to we decided that only having a 18 was not sufficient. So we have 18 with only two sufficiencies to questions efficient and then reaching collecting some other points from insufficient questions but these would not be coerent with double double nature of this course. So this is the rationale behind the putting this criterion. Okay, this was relaxed in the first two editions of the course, the sufficiency could be reached only if both parts were sufficient. Then we realized that it was probably too strict and we found that is compromise that I personally find quite reasonable. So we have two evaluation criteria logical currents and clarity in argumentation. It is very important. If your argumentation is as a very poor logic will be not evaluated with the maximum. And well, this is always correct and some precisions of the answers in all like some of this is this is present. It is important that you remind that only what if you answer to the questions, the text will be evaluated. And unfortunately, I always find quite a lot of exams in which you, there is a question and you answer with unrelated things. I want to stress this point because it's important that you stick to the question and also it's important to write synthetic answer. The solutions that you will find starting from this evening or tomorrow that I will upload on the portal are written in a way that should help you understanding the case. But should not take an as a reference from the point of view of the land, because I, I, especially some exams solutions, I tend to write a lot in order to allow you to understand as much as possible, but do not take that length as as a reference. It should be concise also because you have only 45 minutes. But you need to be clear, concise, and then I can assure you that it is possible to be correct and concise and get the maximum. Okay. Yes, this is the very first appointment where we solve the past exam as exercise. What kind of exam are you will, of case, sorry, you will, you can get. You might get a discriminating nation issue. You might be asked to explain it. Why discrimin

ation occurs. Or to identify. I ask you which risk of discrimination there is in this system and why explanation is always important needed. You might get measurements issues that are most related to the process of the empirical process of measurement that we in which we discussed quite a lot both with a specific focus and in various cases we made examples of measurement issues. And it's in combination. This might be is a sub question, which I ask you one measurement issue or any measurement issues depending on the weight of the sub question. You might have a case for fairness computation. You may directly with a criteria of fairness, one of the three or some other kind of computations that basically are ratios divisions, basic computations to understand what if discrimination occurs, or if there is a risk of discrimination so these can be in a combination with discrimination issues. And then I might ask you also for suggestions for improvement. This is usually a minor. Yes, I will then. Let me check if the camera also. Yes. For God was our sense. Yes, this usually is a minor has a minor aspect. So we have two points to end the health points out of the two seven and a half will make us examples. I ask you how to how the given the discrimination issue that you explained the just explained how could you mitigate it. And also your critical thinking that you should have developed during during the course and seeing all the cases that we have commented the study. Of course, you, you, you can get exercises and exams with combination, even a free of them. Everything is designed to be solved in 45 minutes. So if the case is quite easy, in my opinion, then I might test you against more points. If I think that the case is quite difficult. I might reduce the number of sub questions. So we decide the exam by exam. So there is no rule about that. Also, because I always either invented the cases or many, many times I take real cases and I just simplify them and turn them into a solvable exam. Whenever I take inspiration from a real case, you will find always in the solution after the exam also the URL or the real case. Today, we selected this is focused explanation of discrimination issues. Do you have questions on on this. Okay. I'll just wait a few seconds. That's the camera records this information for the recording. Today is organized. I'm going to solve together with you one for the first exercise so that you can try to follow me step by step in the reasoning and explanations if you have doubts, you interrupt me. And I give you the second explain you introduced to you the second exercise, and then you have to solve by yourself. I will propose you a methodology that I found the various aspects. And it is, I give you about 15 minutes to try to solve the exam by yourself. Then I ask you to be to join in groups free for people and try to combine your own use explanation and so try to solve it together. I, this is a methodology that has been proven either both by scientific studies on methodologies for teaching and by myself in past experiments with students in other exams where the answers were more quantitative. I could, I could quickly verify experimentally that there are the number of correct answers after the group, the group part was extremely higher, but only if the group session follows an individual session. And the group session alone is not so effective. So this is what I'm, I will suggest you to follow later, then you are free, of course, do it or not. Starting from, from the second exercise. There will be a student that will will come and will will help you answering questions or two people every time can go around and me and the assistant that can can answer questions. I think we can proceed directly with the first, the first exam and she switched off the camera. The very first case is that I already uploaded. I will come or a team in January 2021. I will never. I will never solve the theory parts because slides material and the recording is enough. I'm only to highlight that is quite useless to build the glossary of questions of past questions, you have access to all

 the questions, but questions change always, also because I confirm only 80% and 90% of the content year after year. The content is basically the same but there are always variations, because this is an evolving a field, which we need to, to follow the last. The last things happening. Not so because and the second motivation for which do not rely too much on the examples of questions on the questions of the past exams is that in the first two editions, there was another professor teaching Professor the Martin, which covered different aspects that are not covered anymore. This is a clear example because this year we will not do the algorithmic accountability act. Because there was a new, a new version, and I found that it was not. I want to that this new, I want to wait that the new low proposal is a bit more stable in order to teach it. So I decided to remove the algorithm accountability act and so this is a this year is impossible that you get such a question can be useful to check how I make the questions on the theory part of course I always ask you to remember that you are not doing anything and then to show me to show me that you understood. You see summarize the main points. So here I gave up to five points because I thought that this was also difficult and then two and a half points for showing how you could determine the fairness criteria and bias measures that we are not covering this year for the prescription the low proposals. Okay. Now let's go to the case prioritizing passions for intensive care programs. This is a real case that was simplified for for some but everything was real. The health system of USA relies on a risk prediction tool to target passions for high risk care management programs where identified passions are treated with additional resources. The programs are widely considered effective at improving successful treatment outcomes and satisfaction while reducing costs. Because the programs are very expensive. You need the dedicated nurses, extra appointments, lots, etc. The ministry uses the risk prediction tool to identify passions who will benefit the most. So you have a tool that identify who can go who should go to intensive care. This is the goal of the tool. To achieve such a goal to assumption to key assumption are made. Those with the greatest care needs will benefit will benefit the most from the program. Those with the highest medical expenditures are those with the greatest care needs. But there is this equivalence that is made. If you need, if you have a greater care need, so if you really need to go to intensive care. You also spent had higher, more medical expenditures, you spent more money on medicines, past medecaments. It's clear because it was a central point. Under these assumptions, but by the way, these were real. This was the real goal of the system. Under these assumptions, the targeted problem becomes a prediction program predict future medical expenditures of passions. Because if you predict future medical expenditures, you predict because of the assumption made by the say the product owners. You also are, you also need more care. We have a goal that is the highest care need. This is the construct. Okay. And the proxy is used. Can you understand my writing or should I switch to capital letters? Fine. I'm trying to avoid this, but it's impossible. So we try to predict this. This is the target. The target variable. And this is the construct. Sorry, because there are some people following from remote that I asked they asked to check the blackboard I make this exception I will. I will share again. Unfortunately, we'll see most of the time my face, but I will try to make the board visible. As much as it is possible to. Okay, I was speaking with your colleagues remotely. If this is clear, we can go ahead. Developers build the program. They are the algorithm relying on a past data to build a predictor. E, with two parameters. Total medical medical expenditures for a patient I in the year T. For every year and for every patient, I have the way I try to predict the story for every year and every patient, the total cost the t

otal medical expenditures. Is my target. The target is given a data set with the following data on care utilized and built. The patient I over the year T minus one over the previous year. Demographics age. And gender. The health insurance type. It is can have two values. Basic insurance provided by the state by USA. Or commercial insurance. Code of the main illness diagnosis. And then identify for a given illness. Prescribe the medications is a string, a list. Appointment appointments made with type of medical service. Can be surgery radiology. Just a visit. And then the amount categorized by type. Here are some examples. So all these is related to the data that. That we have. It is not know how these features were combined to make the prediction so we don't know the model. An independent audit looks at the algorithm results. So whenever you see an audit means that there was already an audit. The checked the results some results. And the algorithm results. What are the arguments results are the passions identified for the intensive care program. You can approximate it as an evaluation test set. So, that a set with the results or ready applying the algorithm, but not the training set. So one of the most common errors. In this exam was a confusion about this table. It was taken as the composition of the training set, but it is clearly written that these these are the results of the independent audit. And it is clearly written that passions that what is the results of the passion to identify the fourth intensive care program. So it's important that you read carefully. From the point of view of race, the published analysis results are reported in the following table and we have 45,000 white and 5000 black. And the average age in years is 55 and a half for white 45 and a half for black people percentage of female 60% white 70% black. And the distribution of intensive care program so it's 80% white and 80% of the selected is 80% and 20% black. And the rest, these were the overall results. The results are on 50,000 people. And this percentage and at the end we have the 80% just the set of the number of people in the number of people that were predicted to go into intensive care. 80% were white 20% were black. Do we have questions so far. First question provide possible explanation for the results of the audit. Clearly state your own hypothesis and any other information as you suppose in addition to provide data in order to current to support your reasoning you will find always this formula. Give an explanation and any other hypothesis that you're making or any other information that you think is important to make that should be reasonable. And then you just presented. And then I ask you which data which part of the process would you change to better achieve the goal of the system. The goal of the system is, you should check the construct so identify those with highest care need. Let's start commenting. Let's start from from the table. As you can see, there is 80% of white people. 80% of the intensive care selected people is white at 20% is black. And this is of course the discrimination occurring so this is a high disparity, but if you look at the number of of people. That were in the let's call it the test set for simplicity. This is about 10% not this is not about this is 10% this is 5000 divide the over 50,000 is the 10% and this is the 90%. This is clear. So, the cause of the of the imbalance in the output could not be simply the different number of people that were object, the object of the classification, because the balance here was even worse. And this is clear because this is a fundamental passage. Yes, please. Yes. I make a copy of the files so that I can write on it. Okay. So in total we have a 50 it was tested on 50,000 people. Okay. And if you make 45 divide by 50 is 90% and five divide by 50 is the 10%. It's just a consider a is no fairness criteria that is applied. It's just a consideration of the number of people in which it was tested. As you can see, then the number of the rest composition in intensive care program is even better. So, because 20% is made of

 black. Is clear. So, the call this is just to explain you that the cause was not just the number of people present in the test set. So, you can use that information to explain any discrimination. So, take it in this way. If you had a proportional algorithm just taking 1% of the of the black people or 10% of the black people and putting them in intensive care 10% of the white people putting them in nursing care you will why you, you will get exactly the same percentages and neutral algorithm in this sense that will respect will propagate to the same percentages that you find the test set. And that's an explanation that I put and you will find the solution because many at that exam of wrote that it's because of the imbalance here in the training set most about this is not a pre-inset and the percentages are not are even a worst here. And also, you cannot rely on this information to explain the discrimination. This is the message. If this step is clear, I will go ahead. Okay. Let's start from my suggestion is whenever you have an exam of this type and explanation of discrimination that you analyze every variable. And every variable that is given a free tour, whether it is related into the, to the discrimination that we start with demographics. And sex. Let's start from the latter that is gender. We cannot. We don't have any particular reason in this context in this particular context. We say that gender is related to the medical expenses. I remind you that the discrimination can be only in a protected attribute and in these exam, he was asked to explain the discrimination on on ethnic group on race. So here we have gender. We have no connections with nothing else at the moment. The other is age. It's quite, quite reasonable. Instead, the page is related to medical expenditures person 20 years old. If not affected by particular illness, problem health problems. On average, we can expect that. Yes. Okay. What I'm building here is a casual graph or correlation graph is a mix of the two. I put a minus suggest that we you, you, you will remember that there is an inverse relationship. And the age. I'm thinking in terms of being young, the youngest you are the less you spend or in terms of age, the more you are the higher is your age and basically, you can expect that the higher the medical expenditures. So, this is in general, then look at the composition. You can check you can also see that female are more sorry average years, black people. The test set, not in the training set, but in the test set are younger 10 years younger. Then white people, you see from the table. And this is an assumption if we, if we accept the fact that we hypothesize that in the training data would somehow reflect these. These difference in age that is actually also if I quite a known characteristics of that population in USA. But let's stick to the, to the text. If you assume that the trainings, the training data would have the same difference that is 10 years difference is quite a relevant difference in these, in these contexts. We might say that there is a week correlation. I call it a race because it's short. This is valid on the only under certain assumptions. But we can say that it's a, it could be possible at least. Thank you. 10, let's go ahead. B, health insurance type, basic insurance provided by USA or a commercial insurance. This is something that is information that is well known, or at least we mentioned several times that the issue types type has a correlation with medical expenditures, because if you have a base insurance, many things are not covered. Many treatments are not possible. This is a well known, unsolved problems in that context in USA. Because insurance, as I often told you is linked to the job. And also to your economical conditions, health insurance. And this is given a structural inequalities that we highlighted several times. This is linked with the race. So this is the first link, the first explanation that I expected that you mentioned. The insurance types, it is correlated with a race. And insurer types determines the amount of medical expenditures. Because of the

 prediction goal, how this system has been designed. Any questions? Yes. Say again, please. I'm not saying that I didn't say that this is total population. This is the population of the, I called it the test set. The set of the people in which the argument was run. I'm saying that this is an explanation of why it is not admissible that you answer the first question. By saying that we have a discrimination in the output because there is this imbalance in the training set. First of all, because it's not a training set. And secondly, because if you make the percentages, these percentages, so these output is even better than those percentages. I made this explanation because this was a frequent error in the exam. Sorry, there was another question behind. If I don't put other races that in groups, you just stick to the data that is provided. Why? Because of the socio-economic conditions related that is much lower in general on average to black people. We spend a lot of time and spend this kind of days. And this allows you, this prevents you, sorry, to get a lower insurance. And so you spend less. If you want to predict costs, expenditures, here is the chain of costs. Yes, please. Do you want to assume that we may have higher medical bills to help first? Can you repeat? Because there was some noise. Sorry, over there. I can't hear. Would you also like to assume that we may have higher medical bills to help first? In the United States, that's a pretty expensive. Because of child... Childbirth, for example? This is something that cannot be the main cause. So under this very general context, I did not take into account the case. If you are able to, in the example, if you are able to identify the main cause, and then you also mentioned that there is this possibility, maybe not as a main, but as a weaker sexual relation, I can accept. It depends on the overall explanation that you give. So we'll analyze... The percentage of women is higher in the medical bills. Yes. But because here the number of possibilities of medical expenditures is so high, that you need to put the assumption that those types of expenditures are relevant in the overall set. It's not wrong, but it depends also on how you explain it, and whether you identify the main cause. Other questions? Okay, let's go ahead. Code of the main illness that is diagnosed. Prescribe the medications. And a point made. Are all related to expenditures, either directly or either via billed amounts. What you will find in the proposed solution is that you have billed amounts connected with medical expenditures. This is connected with C, variable C, variable D, and variable E. There are some types of health problems that will require higher medical expenditures, that will require higher billed amounts. There are some prescribed medications that will depend of course on the illness, the code of the illness. Prescribed medications will also be highly correlated with types of appointments made. But this is what you see in the right part of the graph. At least with information attained at exam, and even considering all the patterns of inequalities that we analyzed, we can say that we don't have particular reasons to consider all these variables linked to race. We don't have information. We should have some type of more correlational data to understand whether black population is affected by, in a significant way, by certain categories of illness. So we need some extra information that we don't have. So we can safely consider that they're not related. Also this is, but it's inflation. Yes, please. In my mind, I think the very few that someone is poor, the person would make less appointments, and get the last medicine. If you feel, depending on the way you express it and the over-logical reasoning, I can accept it. But the main driver here is that one. This is quite clear. And if you miss that one, and you present only that link, it's a bit poor as an explanation. So you will always get the solutions as indications for a possible solution. So every solution that you get, a text that you will get after the exercise is after the exam, is pro

posed as a guide to the solution. Then I need to follow your logical reasoning, your own logical reasoning that you expose in the exam. There are certain elements that must be there, like the link with insurance type. Other considerations that were made here, they might be accessible, but provided your overall reasoning how you express them. This one, the one on maternity costs, so depends on how you express them. You don't need to provide me also because exam is on the laptop, the whole graph. I make the graph to better explain the guide to the solution. Then, second question, which data, which part of the process would you change to better achieve the goal of the system? Well, here it really depends on your critical thinking and capacity to make the imagination step. But examples of acceptable answers are the following. First of all, look at the construct and the target variable. There is a mismatch, a clear mismatch that caused the discrimination also in the real case. If you measure the highest care need with the highest expenditures, you are missing your construct. If you want to measure, to predict the highest care, you might, I mentioned in the example solution, you might check the number of active chronic or serious health conditions instead of medical expenditures. You might have a kind of a flag on whether conditions are critical or the number of critical issues that you have. This is a medical information that is, you can think that is obtainable. You also have a variable that combines the health prediction, the health status with expenditures. You might also do not include, so do not get rid of the at all to medical expenditures, but you should mitigate the impact. You might have a building combined index, but the important thing is that you should measure really the construct that is health conditions. Since I also mentioned not only the data, but also part of the process, you could also reason in terms of information given to the doctors. So that's not only giving a prediction. Yes, no, eligible for intensive care, not eligible. But you can provide also a side, an informative box on what are the current health conditions. What are the the story, the most important or most common medical appointments, what are the most common medical issues of this person. So that the doctor, the final decision can be taken also not only relying only on a number, but also looking at contextual information. So, there is no possibility. An improvement that you could, you could put in place in order to avoid or mitigate the discrimination issue. Yes, please. Isn't the last thing that you said already present is the way the teachers like prescribed medications, all of them in. Yeah, I stick to the information available. So I just say that the output should not be only a prediction, but should there should be also some context of information. Yes. Writing only as an answer to this point, removing medical expenditures. That's not enough. You need to be, you need to propose something. In my mind, this type of question should help you in achieving a higher mark. And usually it is, but sometimes, as well as where to poor. And I repeat what I already said, do not over rely on the examples provided so do not overfit your preparation on the examples provided, because otherwise you might encounter problems. There is a slight variation in the, in the questions might put you in troubles. In one exam, I made the same question, but the goal was not to better achieve. Well, the final part of the question was not to better achieve the goal of the system. The final part was to be able to compute separation, the separation criteria. Unfortunately, many, many people did not went in an automatic way, did not read the, the last part of the last words of the question and answer it with improvements goals. They were not the question. So be, be careful on what I ask. Okay. My suggestion would be to go ahead and you organize yourself with a break, if you agree. So I present you the next text, and then I leave you some time to start doing it. And we can do like this. I present you the text. This is a

 proposal I present you the text and then I give you 40 minutes, 50 minutes, you do it alone 50 minutes in group. 10 minutes. If you want to make a break during the solving exercise and then I will, I will solve it. This final you prefer to have a common break now. Who prefer to have a common break right now. Just raise your hand. Okay, you are the majority. So I need to reverse my proposal. And we start in 10 minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay, the second, the second case that is the exercise that you will do is student success predictive model. Okay. Can you please take your place because I need to start. Thank you. I will read it, explain a few things. And then you are left 15 minutes alone and 15 minutes in group. Here is Christian that will help you will help me and you in answering doubts and during while solving the exercise. Okay. So the first exam of the summer session. The company ABC software.com in short ABC says a service based on the student success predictive model SSPM to predict the graduation likelihood of university students in USA. So this is the target variable. Whenever you see to predict something, this is what you want to predict. So graduation likelihood. Once the software produces predictions. No further guidance is given to professors who serve as student advisors. And it is up to the school to decide what to do with predictions. Typically the service is used by university to recommend students and changing major or to withdraw their career. And it turns you on the usage of this prediction, the tool outputs the model outputs a prediction and say is Mario Rossi as very low likelihood. Very low probability to graduate. Then the usage of this prediction is left up to the school. And sometimes if a prediction is a negative, it's bad for the student. A recommendation of changing major or to leave the university is made. But this is a human. This is the human part of the decision process. The predictions are made with a university specific model. That means the model is specific to the given university. Each university is its own model. A customized set of predictors is constructed from student records of the specific university and then combined and weighted using an automated training process designed to maximize predictive accuracy. Historical student records that are used in the training set satisfy the following criteria. Matriculated between 1st September 2005 and 31st July 2010, five years, and at least three registered successful exams passed. Yearly subscription takes taxes regularly paid. These are conditions for the data. Predictions are made on any type of student either from incoming freshmen or to newly graduating seniors. Any type of students can be object of the prediction. If you are first year student or if you are the last year and the final ranks provided with success scores from low to high. Among the predictors used for training the model in university X, the ones which had a higher impact on the score of the software responsible for more than 5% of the variance in scores are the following ones. This was noise, this information you could also ignore. The important message of this center is that all the following variables had higher impact on the score of the software. Well, I'm already explaining you a little bit of the solution but it's to help you. Because I wrote that the ones which had the higher impact on the score of the software and you have a list of variables. This list actually was not what you got at the exam because you got only half of the variables. There were two versions of the exam. In this exam, in this exercise, I provide you with all the variables, all possible variables. But each student at the time got only half of the variables. And then one of these two tables that you will see. To solve the exercise, now you take into consideration all the variables. This is my strong recommendation. And then you select one of the two tables that are equivalent. I designed them to be absolutely equivalent. And also the variables are designed to be in the two exam versions, absolutely equivalent. And the variables are admit co

de, student admission type, which can be these are the levels, the options for the variable, first time freshman, transfer from another university, conditional admit. Documentation missing exam, for example. First generation indicator, yes or no. An indicator of whether any of an individual's parents ever earned a bachelor degree. So if a parent of a student, one of the two parents already holds a bachelor degree, this variable is yes. Hold at least a bachelor degree. Otherwise, no. Income by admission zip code, the median household income in the zip code of a student's home at the time of admission. So when you are admitted to a university, you also declare your zip code and from external statistics, the median household income of debt. The method zip code is automatically translated in this variable. High school GPA, a student high school grade point average, your average scores at the high school. Legacy indicator, yes or no, is whether the parent of the student had a family or any other family member attended the same college. This is called legacy indicator. So if imagine you enroll the polytechnic and one of your parents studied a polytechnic, then this variable will be yes. Otherwise, will be no. If it studies at the University of Talla Sapienza di Roma, no, will be no. International indicator, yes or no. Indicator, whether an individual is an international student. High school percentile, a student's high school rank in terms of percentile in that specific high school. So where the student was in the rank of the high school, high school size, the size of an individual's high school student's student body. So you come from a given high school that is very small or you come from a high school that is, that is very large. So whether indicator, yes or no, whether a student is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces. In state resident indicator, yes or no, whether a student is a resident of the University home state. So if you are resident in Piedmont, your role to polytechnic here is yes. An audit found large disparities in the software outcomes for students of different races according to the following table. So different races, this is the discrimination. You have black, white, Latino, Asian, and your frequencies. Success, prediction is success. Prediction is moderate success. Prediction is failure. Prediction is unknown. And here you are provided with a table. We can agree that we all take as a reference table one. Table two is equivalent, but we can say that you all now take as a reference table one. Provide the possible explanations for the results of the audit. Clearly state your own hypothesis and any other information that you suppose in addition to provide that in order to currently support your reasoning. Which measurement issues do you observe? Do not do it now. I will do, we will do it together. And then do it. Which data, which part of the process would you change to make the impact to the system less harmful? This is part of your work now. One comment before I leave you with the text. And this was too long. It was way too long. So I then I adjusted a little bit the marks because I realized after the exam that I asked you too many things. So don't take it as a regular exam, let's say. So don't worry, it will not be as long as this exam. Okay. So it is important that you start analyzing the test individually. And take some time and then try to solve the first question, at least. And possibly also have a thinking to the third one. So let's do the 15 minutes alone. Well, this is my suggestion. Then after 15 minutes, I will tell you that 50 minutes past it and then you can work in groups and then we comment together. Just raise your hand and Christian and me will come. And I will stop the recording now. Okay. Here is a possible a possible solution, at least a guide to a possible solution that I will share with you now. And I'm using the questions that you make me and to make a few feet a few modifications to the prepared solution. So it will take me one or two days just the time to change a little bit to improve a little bit to the text that you that

you I will give you. And then I will upload the solutions. This is just to inform you about the timing on when you will get the solutions of this exam. In one to days, roughly. In my in the proposed solution that you will find. There is a guiding idea that is driven by this sentence. The service is used by university to recommend students changing major or to withdraw the career. This is the decision that is made how the prediction is used to make the decision. If you remember, I wrote you a formula that decision. Can be a decision. Can be. Okay, let me switch on the camera. Okay, then. When we formalize the problem of bias and the problem of fairness we say that decision can be either inter a direct function of the classification. It can be take the classification as it is or can be in function of classification. Maybe some protected articles and any other relevant variable information. So, this means that the decision can be made directly the specific prediction made or indirectly on top of the classification made. The case is a bit in the middle because the likelihood the graduation likelihood is used to recommend that you should change university or should we withdraw. So is used in a complementary way. Basically only when you predict a failure. This is what will guide the proposal solution. With this in mind, this is not the only possible solution is what you will find as what I propose. But this is the explanation of why I take into account in the table only the failures basically. You could sum up basically success, moderate success with a category that is are equal to one, for instance, you could drop the unknown, or you can sum up to the to the success it never minds what it's, it's mostly informative is the failure. There is no need to compute a fairness criteria because it was not asked. Here. You could in order to identify what are the disadvantage that races because I tell you in the exam as in the previous time I tell you that there is a problem. I don't directly mention what a team group is advantage disadvantage. The previous exam was there were only two acting groups and was pretty clear that were the black disadvantage disadvantage. In this exam, you need to understand who are the discriminated who are the disadvantage. So, the black and Latinos, basically, if you look at the failure at the road failure and one possible way would be to compute among the 2800 and 800 predictions with failure. Roughly, if I didn't if I remember should be 45% is made by black people among I'm using this the role just computation the person, the composition of these 2800 people is 45% black. And it is a 38% Latino. And the 45 is just to make it clear comes from this. It's just an observation, you could make several other computations as we should, but it was the table was built in such a way that the discrimination should be clearly identified towards black and towards Latinos, because here. It's less than 10% basically, but the table was built in a way that the order of magnitude in the black and Latinos was particularly different than the order of magnitude of white asia that should be clear within a few, if not few seconds in a few minutes that where the discrimination issue resides. So having identified what are the, the disadvantage category groups. Most of the difficulty, I think it was solved because we know that all these variables were related to the predictor were relevant for the prediction, the text says it had higher impact. And those information that was was given. What you had to find was the relationship with the disadvantage that the groups. Well, here we cannot find any type of correlation with ethnic group, the type of admissions is not related. First generation indicator. Well, this is clearly connected. If your parents, if this exam was given in 2021, it means that the parents of people at the university 2021 should be roughly in the 60s roughly. So we can assume that this is connected with the group because of the structural inequality of attendance in US universities, in general. And then the previous generation was particularly even more relevant.

 So, this is an immediate income. This was this is also something that is correlated with ethnic group. No assumption to be made here. High school, the performance of a student is a given high school. We don't have information in the text, neither in the text nor in the in the trends identified trends of inequalities that we we saw during the course so we will leave it as not relevant for the explanation. And this is similar to first generation indicator legacy indicator whether your parent was a family member attended the same college. So whether got a variable be did not get also variable if they were designed to be equivalent. This is the same reasoning is behind so they were not in the same exam. Text. International. No, well, yes, international indicator. This is something that is. I was quite flexible in the acceptance or not of this criterion. I don't have information that this should be a relevant to the ethnic group. International is international students says nothing from where from comes from the global north from the global south. So, is not is not relevant. It's not connected to the to the ethnic group. Then G. High school person till we don't have information to say some ethnic groups perform better than others. It is very this is this variable is equivalent to high school GPA. So, again, who got variable D didn't get also a variable G high school size this was different because usually private high schools might be considered to be smaller and so private schools cost more. So, again, the private school might be correlated to ethnic group. And this is also an acceptable indication for explanation. This is a veteran indicator. I put in yellow because it is connected with ethnic group because we have no particular indication indication for not assuming that in the army there is a majority of white people because the majority of the US population is white. And if you check the statistics also is like this if you check the official statistics on the army composition is like this. However, is correlated to white people, not to, to the disadvantage ethnic group. So I'm putting this in yellow. Maybe I should change color because is connected to the group. So this is a strong explanation of a strong explanation for the discrimination. But it is connected. And in state indicator is similar although complimentary to variable left. Unless it is written that university X is an estate, which there is a specific composition of the ethnic groups we don't have other information and any others. General trend to say that this is connected with ethnic group and it is a possible cause of explanation. So it was built the text in such a way that you had two indicators out of five to be identified. Here you have the whole list but remember that the exam was split in two versions equivalent. Of course, depending on your own exam how you explain things. I tailor my evaluation. If you put the name of a variable without explaining it doesn't count. So if you, if you correctly identify variable C but you then you don't explain me why you put variable C as an explanation discrimination doesn't count. So. So that was a question on measurement issues that I told you not to do by yourself because I provide you some examples. A first example of measurement issue is a possible aggregation bias, because the model, it is used to any type of student is written here. From incoming freshmen to nearly graduating seniors. And if you make a prediction on people that is very close to the graduation, the weight of some predictor is very different. If you in the case of incoming freshmen incoming students for the latter ones, for example, the indicators on the performances in high school could be stronger than the indicator for a student who almost finished the university degree. One this is so it will be for this context it would be important to build the different models models for people entering the year at the first year for instance, and model for more senior students, because the predictors can be can perform very differently, given the context at hand. Another type of measurement issues is

 that you are using data from 2005 to 2010, which had also in the time span, a big event, global event that is the economical crisis of 2008 that could have changed totally the economic condition of people and use this data from 10 years ago that you are using data with from. So you're training an algorithm with data that is the near sold for predicting so without using more recent data. So the variation bias here is a measurement issue. Of course, it is also always valid the fact that you're using a group statistics to make individual predictions. So, especially in this context, you might have that one variable might be particularly relevant for for a given student, but not for another student. This is always true. So, using general patterns to have to make individual predictions is always a limitation. So you should be. You should be more, more specific when identifying a measurement issues. So the first two issues that I told you are mostly relevant. So training data that is to all the inadequate for the task attend and subgroups that should be made because you are predicting things very that are very types of people that are very different. So you should be able to make the different models given also the information that is carried by these these variables. And you could start from the measurement issues also to propose improvements to the to the to the project to the system. One consequence is that of what I said is that you should build different models. This is also one on possible improvement of the system. Most frequent errors that were found in this exam, as I said, this was too long. So I adjusted the marks at the end. I raised everything a little bit. These are so what you see here the criterion for that a collection are not predictors. So people confused took these criterion as variables and use them to make explanations. And this is this wrong. The text said clearly that all these variables were relevant predictors saying that one variable is not a relevant predictor was not the question the question was to identify among them. And these were connected to a team group. Other frequent error is missing an explanation. So you identify a feature, you say this because of this discrimination accord the because of let's say, feature see but you don't explain it. It's not valid. The result that I give you is not the training data was the result of the audit and answering to measurement issues with an explanation of a discrimination. No, this is not possible. The two exams were repeating basically the explanation of the discrimination also in question in question to measurement issues we know that are different from discrimination issues. There are limitations of the model that you build the other data collection process, etc. There are frequent errors. Okay. I have the text of the third exercise a bit late but we'll try. I still propose you. Okay, there are questions. Yes. Okay. And what you should explain why it is a bad choice. A colleague of you previously asked me whether this could be also an explanation for discrimination. So, you know, it depends on your overall answer. So if you point it as a main explanation is not not enough. Also consider that the system is different you go, you borrow money. You don't pay the taxes basically. So but this is contextual information so I could accept it to provide that you explain it well and that you identify the real the most relevant causes of explanation so I'm a bit flexible, but it always depends on how you you bring to me the information. Any other questions. Okay, I made I make the following proposal. I introduce you very quickly the next exercise, and you start doing it. As earlier, Christian will help you with questions. I will show you if there is time at the solution next time. I will upload the solution, because there is no time to do both now. So, the next exercise is insurance. I quickly read it. So insurance. Also this was a real case. An Italian car insurance provider experimented the use of machine learning for predicting the risk of repaying the cost of cause the incident in a year for a person for a

 given person. In case of high risk, a higher premium is offered to the applicant who can then accept the quarter notes. The company used the part of its own historical data from 2010 to 2020 to train a classifier during the experimentation applicants could get their quote at a filling a form with data about the current themselves. The fields field are the same used by the classifier. In addition to that data. Applicants were required to input information and ethnic group. Although this sensitive data was not used by the classification algorithm. It was collected to test the classification against discrimination. The classification is true is on a race. In fact, the national international regulations require that prices should not vary depending on the group. And they also forbid the training of classification prediction algorithms with it. So, race is given as information by the user, but it's not used in the classification algorithm. All that information. Yes. The group at the three possible values Caucasian black as the attic. The feature used by the classifier are birthplace, the driver nations of birth, the list of all possible countries in the world age drivers age between 1800 city the drivers, residents where the driver resides live in Italy. The car is a 200 vehicle type that used from the car model and the year, and it has two possible values, small cars and large powerful cars, only two levels claim history, number of previous claims with free possible values less than free between three and six more than six, and the estimation kilometers driven in a year. The analysis of the data gathered during the six month experimentation, show that offer the price by the significantly when only ethnic group different, while all other characteristics were equal. This means there was a problem with the respects to ethnic group. The company dismissed the the locked on the system and blah blah blah. This is not interesting. So provide a possible explanation of the results of the experimentation why there is a discrimination by ethnic group. And which measurement issues and which changes in the experimentation data. In these 15 minutes that you have just focus on the possible explanation. Okay. We have the text in the material and try to think about it. I will now close also the recording and given that I will.
